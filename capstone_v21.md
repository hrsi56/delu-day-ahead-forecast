# Capstone v21-r12 — unrestricted work availability (Owner-authorized 2026-10-10)

Authorized work may run on every day and at any time, under `AGENTS.md` § Work availability.
The Owner removed calendar-based work restrictions, advance clock checks, mandatory pauses
and resumption exceptions throughout the project. Resource ceilings and research requirements
are unchanged. The prior revision is preserved at `522d7ea:capstone_v21.md`.

Authority and scope: [r11 → r12 amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r11-to-v21-r12-amendments.md).
The r11 authority record below describes that historical revision; its additions-only statement
does not describe the scheduling deletions made in r12.

## Historical authority: Capstone v21-r11 — CP-24: DDNN-2, a literature-faithful DDNN, and v5 = v4 plus a DDNN-2 member; CP-23's outcome (ratified)

**Ratified on 2026-10-05 under the Owner's delegation of 2026-10-04.** After CP-23 closed, the
Owner delegated a second DDNN route to the Orchestrator, to run without the Owner until the report
and the LAND request. The delegation has four parts:

- **The route.** An independent research agent proposes directions, the Orchestrator writes the
  plan, an independent critic reviews it, and the Orchestrator sends it to an execution agent:
  "תכין תוכנית עבודה לDDNN-2 , תעביר אותה אצל סוכנים באופן עצמאי תחתיך. סוכן מחקר עצמאי ובלתי
  תלוי יכין לך כיוונים אפשריים, אתה תכין תכנית, תשלח אותה למבקר עצמאי שיבחן ויבדוק אותה אחר כך
  תשלח בעצמך לסוכן ביצוע את DDNN-2 בלי לערב אותי".
- **The goal.** "המטרה היא לתת לך שליטה מלאה על הביצוע תוך הבטחה למאמץ ממוקד ומקסימלי ובקרה
  בכל שלב ככה שתוכל לכוון ולנסות למצוא דרך בה DDNN כן תוכל לשמש אותנו."
- **The authority.** "לצורך זה כמובן יש לך השעיית Lockdown לסעיף עוגן חדש,  הסעיף יגדיר את DDNN-2
  ואת האישור לכל הצרכים לו, וכלול בו אישור כמובן ל-commit ו-push ולכל מה שצריך."
- **The discretion.** "הייצוג, היקף חיפוש ההיפר-פרמטרים, האנסמבל, המשקל בתוך v5 והתקרות כולם
  לשיקולך וניתנים לשינוי גם תוך כדי העבודה אם תצטרך", and then "תמשיך באופן חופשי ומלא עד דוח
  ובקשת LAND".

What this revision adds, as additions only:

- **§21.13** records CP-23's outcome.
- **§23** specifies CP-24: DDNN-2, its training-only search, a pre-fold gate, at most two
  pre-registered scored attempts, and the Orchestrator's steering points.
- **§10** gains one CP-24 row.

Apart from §10's new row and the inserted §21.13, no line changes. The headers below, §§1–21.12
and §22 remain byte for byte.

**Status:** ratified, and CP-24's execution granted, under the Owner's delegation (§23.14).

Previous v21-r10 is preserved at `3f7aaf2:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`6873c2501067c63692ec7cb79dfd4073164a8a014edbd6ebc23169e7e8ff6709`.

**Authority.** The Owner's words above are quoted with their English sense in
[the amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r10-to-v21-r11-amendments.md).

- **What the grant covers.**
  - **A Lockdown suspension.** It is task-scoped and covers this revision and its amendment
    record.
  - **No revision of §23 during CP-24.** The Owner's discretion over the ceilings "during the
    work" is exercised only as §23.6 allows: a stated raise of a §23.11 ceiling, committed before
    use. Any other choice made during the work is a steering decision within §23's bounds.
  - **Rules of `orchestrator-role.md` set aside for CP-24 only, without editing the file:**
    - that the Orchestrator never launches an executor session;
    - that the Owner carries every brief and return;
    - for the Critic fallback only, that the Orchestrator never reads or manages internal agent
      exchanges.

    §23.6 names exactly what replaces them.
  - **Execution.** CP-24's execution, under §23.
  - **Commit and push** of five things:
    - this revision;
    - its amendment record;
    - the research report;
    - the brief's record in `progress.md`;
    - the programme handoff's consistency edits.
- **When it ends:** at CP-24's terminal return. The LAND stays the Owner's, by hand.
- **Who wrote it.** The Orchestrator drafted this text under the delegation, from an independent
  research agent's directions, and revised it after an independent plan critic's review. It made
  every design choice the Owner did not state, and §23.15 marks each one. This is not a claim
  that the Owner reviewed every sentence.

# Capstone v21-r10 — CP-23: the DDNN route, v5 = v4 plus a DDNN member; CP-22's outcome; the programme order (ratified)

**Ratified by the Owner on 2026-10-04.** CP-22 closed with no replacement. The Owner then
decided four things:

- v4 stays as it is: "v4 נשאר כפי שהוא";
- v5 = v4 plus a DDNN member, competing against v4: "v5 = v4 ועוד רכיב DDNN", "יתחרה כמובן מול
  V4";
- this revision anchors that, under a Lockdown suspension, and records CP-22's outcome against
  §20.1;
- the order after CP-22, in this sequence:
  - the automation items;
  - DDNN;
  - a comprehensive data-admission research, together with 4.4V;
  - 4.8 with a meta-learner;
  - 4.7T at the end.

What this revision adds, as additions only:

- **§20.13** records CP-22's outcome.
- **§21** specifies CP-23: programme 4.6, run through its route 4.6L → 4.6R → 4.6C inside one
  checkpoint.
- **§22** fixes the programme order after CP-22.
- **§10** gains one CP-23 row.

No other line changes: the headers below and §§1–20.12 remain byte for byte.

**Status:** ratified under the Owner's grant. CP-23's execution needs the Owner's separate grant
when its brief is issued (§21.11).

Previous v21-r9 is preserved at `940eb98:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`5fc9c6862aa9f623af29db295e79456ecd94c60e213f8f286cdca97153e09175`.

**Authority.** On 2026-10-04 the Owner wrote: "צריך סעיף עוגן חדש, v21-r10, תחת השעיית Lockdown.
הסעיף יתעד גם את תוצאת CP-22 מול §20.1. מאושר באופן מלא, כולל השעיה וכולל קומיט פוש מה שאתה
צריך". After the sequence above was set, the Owner added "בצע". The exact words are quoted in
[the amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r9-to-v21-r10-amendments.md).

- **What the grant covers.** It acts as a task-scoped Lockdown suspension for:
  - this revision;
  - its amendment record;
  - directly necessary consistency edits to the programme handoff and `progress.md`.
- **When it ends:** at this task's terminal return.
- **Who wrote it.** The agent drafted this text under that authority. It also fixed the design
  choices the Owner did not state, and §21.12 marks each one. This is not a claim that the Owner
  reviewed every sentence.

# Capstone v21-r9 — CP-22: v4 revised, with one pooled member and a dynamic interval layer (ratified)

**Ratified by the Owner on 2026-10-01, and CP-22's execution authorized the same day.** The Owner
asked to re-examine v4 before DDNN, then made five decisions:

- the new version replaces v4;
- the block split is removed in every outcome;
- decisions D1–D8 are approved as recommended;
- if both eligible policies fail, CP-22 stops and returns to the Owner;
- the interval layer must learn more dynamically than a rigid 28-day buffer.

New §20 specifies CP-22, and one CP-22 row is added to §10's table. No other line changes: the
headers below and §§1–19 remain byte for byte. **Status:** drafted under the Owner's task-scoped
suspension, then ratified, with execution authorized: "נותן לך את: 1. אישור הטקסט. 2. אישור ביצוע CP-22. 3. הוראה ואישור לעשות commit ו-push לכל המסמכים בעצמך. נעשה הכל מקומית".

Previous v21-r8 is preserved at `c352436:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`81d6127197cabf344f56c2cf25ef5fc8f9fdb2860e249c294177471d3130c182`.

**Authority.** On 2026-10-01 the Owner approved decisions D1–D8 as recommended and wrote:
"ההשעיה תכסה כל מה שצריך". The exact words are quoted in
[the amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r8-to-v21-r9-amendments.md).

- **What the grant covers.** It acts as a task-scoped Lockdown suspension for:
  - this revision;
  - PUBLISH_RULES 1.3 (A10);
  - their amendment record;
  - directly necessary consistency edits to the programme handoff and `progress.md`.
- **When it ends:** at this task's terminal return.
- **Who wrote it.** The agent drafted this text under that authority. This is not a claim that
  the Owner reviewed every sentence.

# Capstone v21-r8 — final-product Space: what it computes and claims (Owner-authorized)

**Owner-authorized amendment, 2026-09-30.** The Owner asked for a plan that makes the Hugging
Face Space the final product's useful, informative tool: trained and updated daily, with a
"Train it yourself" button, anchored by authority and implemented once a final model exists.
New §19 anchors the research side: what the Space computes, what it may claim, and the
in-browser retraining requirement. The presentation side is PUBLISH_RULES 1.2 §7.3 (A9); the
implementation plan is `docs/track-b/final-product-space-plan-2026-09-30.md`. §19 opens no
checkpoint, designates no model, and grants no publication or scheduling authority. Every
existing line is unchanged: the headers below and §§1–18 remain byte for byte. §19 refines §16.3
and §18.2's deferral of in-browser retraining, and it governs only within that scope.

Previous v21-r7 is preserved at `c9dc364:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`e6a4e301d5db080c6427f925f51e2cf69367c42225b292c78050117003aa7b0c`.

**Authority.** On 2026-09-30 the Owner granted task-wide authority for a plan anchored "split by
authority"; the exact words are quoted in
[the amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r7-to-v21-r8-amendments.md). The grant acts as a
task-scoped Lockdown suspension. It covers this revision, PUBLISH_RULES 1.2, their records and
directly necessary consistency edits to the programme handoff and `progress.md`, and it ends at
this task's terminal return. The agent drafted this text under that delegated authority; this
is not a claim that the Owner reviewed every sentence.

---

# Capstone v21-r7 — distribution challenger: DDNN only, written in NumPy (Owner-authorized)

**Owner-authorized amendment, 2026-09-30.** The Owner withdrew TabPFN from the programme and
fixed how DDNN is built: from the start, in NumPy only, with PyTorch serving only as a
correctness check on the development machine. New §18 records both decisions for programme work
item 4.6. It opens no checkpoint, authorizes no DDNN execution, spends no budget and designates
no final product. Every existing line is unchanged: the headers below and §§1–17 remain byte for
byte. §18 refines §16.2's TabPFN example and the programme handoff's 4.6 route, and it governs
only within that scope.

Previous v21-r6 is preserved at `270a0a0:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`ee402c4703d176f8181ed82966c978ad84c3c73a0cdb1d3567871f58bc867344`. CP-21's evidence binds those
bytes; v21-r7 neither reopens nor rescores it.

**Authority.** On 2026-09-30 the Owner granted full authority to edit the anchors' treatment of
DDNN and TabPFN, with the two decisions above; the exact words are quoted in
[the amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r6-to-v21-r7-amendments.md). The grant acts as a
task-scoped Lockdown suspension. It covers this revision, that record and directly necessary
consistency edits to the programme handoff and `progress.md`, and it ends at this task's
terminal return. The agent drafted this text under that delegated authority; this is not a
claim that the Owner reviewed every sentence.

# Capstone v21-r6 — CP-21: three-block LightGBM on top of v3 (ratified)

**Owner-ratified 2026-09-29; CP-21 execution authorized the same day.** The Owner chose programme
work item 4.5 for CP-21, on top of v3: add a LightGBM split into three hour blocks to v3,
retrain, and publish the result for comparison in either outcome. If it improves on v3 under a
rule fixed in advance, it is adopted as v4 and becomes the base for the next extensions.
Otherwise it is documented and published as a not-adopted experiment.

**What was ratified.** The Orchestrator's draft, with two changes by the Owner:

- **D1:** a pooled attribution arm, L-P, tests whether the block split itself helps.
- **D2:** a fourth adoption condition vetoes a resolved per-fold degradation.

The Owner approved D3–D6 as recommended, with the ceilings recomputed for the added arm. New §17
specifies the checkpoint, and one CP-21 row is inserted in §10's table. Apart from that row,
every existing line is unchanged: the headers below and §§1–16 remain byte-for-byte, and §16
remains the final-product authority.

Previous v21-r5 is preserved at `81ab3be:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`a4e178c30c555cc91dfbe338bbcf3e8776d67709d6dc4a72bc4f5892971003c9`.

**Authority.** The Owner granted a task-scoped Lockdown suspension of 2026-09-29. It covers this
revision, [the amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r5-to-v21-r6-amendments.md) and
directly necessary consistency edits to the programme handoff, and it ends at that task's
terminal return. The Owner separately authorized the task to commit and push these documents.
That was a task-scoped instruction, not a standing exception. The CP-21 Engineering Lead
receives only the execution authority in §17.11.

---

# Capstone v21-r5 — final-product lifecycle amendment (ratified)

**Owner-authorized documentation amendment · 2026-09-29.** New §16 makes the
Owner-designated final version the product/demo/daily-policy identity and requires daily
retraining and issuance under a frozen policy. It governs future final-product work only.
It does not choose a model, authorize CP-21 or CP-17–19 execution, spend a budget, open
fresh data or grant publication authority. All historical §§1–15 below remain byte-for-byte
unchanged; §16 explicitly refines future §§9–10 and wins only within that stated scope.

Previous v21-r4 is preserved at `evidence/pres-2:capstone_v21.md`, SHA-256
`150bd53fa15067b1d138c95d0912f86a1e92ce74092059be09034758c1926167`.
The Owner approved the named task-scoped Lockdown suspension with “מאשר באופן מלא” after
specifying the final-product identity and page order. See
[amendment record](docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r4-to-v21-r5-amendments.md).
The suspension covers this amendment and necessary document consistency only and expires at
terminal return. Historical CP-20 acceptance remains v21-r4; later research needs its own brief.

---

# Capstone v21-r4 — direct-GFS research amendment (ratified)

**CP-20 ratified and separately authorized to execute · 2026-09-23.** Owner ratifies the
revised §15 specification and all approved ceilings, and authorizes local candidate/evidence
commits and exact immutable packaging under §15.7. This issuance changes status/identities only.
The ratified CP-16 v21-r3 bytes remain at `evidence/cp-16:capstone_v21.md`, SHA256
`67d2176865fea4d6ada0b13bafb128016970d78337d5a936890ddbff7c3ad6ed`.
The historical text below is retained; CP-16 is closed per its landing record, not resumed
by this document. Only new §15 governs the authorized CP-20 weather experiment. CP-17–19 and
all existing substantive requirements remain unchanged.

---

# Capstone v21-r3 — Adaptive forecasting with measured product quality (ratified)

**Owner-ratified resource amendment and CP-16 resumption authorization · 2026-09-23.**
The Owner ratified exactly the §14.5 cap/counting change: **6 full-equivalent H/P passes /
9,000 cumulative policy-days**, retaining the entire **3,730** historical debit and all other
resource ceilings/debits, scientific requirements, candidates, data boundaries, metrics and
claims. The forward-looking rule and resumption conditions are specified in §14.5. This is a
maximum allowance, not a spending target or guaranteed feasibility; no reset or retrospective
monitoring compliance is granted. The Owner expressly authorized resumption under the resulting
consistent anchor/issued brief and these implementing successors without another approval round.

The task-scoped suspension covers this anchor's §14.5 and directly necessary revision/status/
accounting references, plus `docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r2-to-v21-r3-amendments.md` only.
It ends at this Orchestrator task's return and transfers no governance-edit authority to the
Lead. No experiment or executor launch occurs in this document task. The existing authorized
local candidate/evidence workflow and exact immutable packaging remain available to the Lead;
no mainline staging/commits/merges, publication, later checkpoint or other governance edit.

**Resume the existing CP-16 checkpoint.** Preserve `gauntlet/cp-16`, the reviewed candidate
`3a160fd33ed92bb0061144cfbce2323d8b3a7db9`, evidence tip
`41b0e6d222a3d65d474ac5974c6eb7017db317e8`, independent FAIL, interrupted evidence and all
historical limitations. No scientific result follows from that interrupted attempt. The Lead
performs the §14.5 feasibility/accounting and evidence-regeneration conditions before dependent
experimental work. Weather admission under programme §4.1 is not a prerequisite.

Historical issued v21-r2 identities (exact bytes retained at the evidence tip above):

| Historical document | SHA256 |
|---|---|
| `capstone_v21.md`, v21-r2 | `a05700ef6de700a956f6d8725cd45ecbc13f2384f780c309fffc5ba835d80a2d` |

Historical v21-r1 for CP-15 remains at `evidence/cp-15:capstone_v21.md`, SHA256
`44ea4e545d2caa276a36a7a70db6ea044b3975196ead06f3ce59f976c83354b3`.
v21-r3 is the current CP-16 authority; the research step serves the unchanged live-system
objective. The complete §14.8 checklist and substantive §§8–9 remain unchanged. CP-16 follows
§14 and its issued brief; the original CP-15-only readiness, methods, paths and handoff below
remain historical instructions, not CP-16 entry authority. No publication, model promotion,
registry mutation, CP-17/18/19 authority or prospective clock follows. Original CP-15 text
is preserved except the previously amended §10 CP-16 status row.


**Active owner-authorized execution plan · 2026-09-15.** The owner approved execution of the
research recommendation and the necessary plan change. The Orchestrator drafted this exact text
under that delegated authority; this is not a claim that the owner reviewed every sentence.
It replaces v20 for future work. Original v20 remains the historical authority for CP-10.

**Owner-authorized history correction, v21-r1 · 2026-09-16.** The owner approved §5’s
expanding history capped at 728 calendar days, retaining the deliberate 2019-01-01 boundary,
and the directly necessary resumption handoff. This is the exact active revision of
`capstone_v21.md`; the original v21 bytes remain historical authority for CP-15 attempt 1
at evidence tip `193d9cf48c586b9c4b1f43d7a5677b2d5f400832` (original plan SHA256
`62e84ceb4f35190c89faffaee4e8af01c5b3c81f9d78f9f3f68556e25f360065`). Its BLOCKED return
and Integration FAIL are not rescored. The nine-policy set, §8 product criteria and complete
§12 checklist are unchanged. The amendment authorizes one CP-15 resumption brief; it grants
no standing governance-edit permission to the Lead.

## 1. Objective, authority and preserved evidence

Deliver a DE-LU day-ahead forecasting product with demonstrably useful point predictions and
uncertainty. A correctly completed experiment is not proof that its resulting model is good.
32% or 40% coverage of nominal 95% intervals is inadequate.

Only **CP-15** is execution-ready in this version. CP-11–CP-14 under v20 are superseded as future
instructions, not silently completed. Later work requires its own complete bar and brief.
CP-10 retains its Integration PASS and unresolved product result. Its branch disposition remains
undecided; nothing here authorizes landing or reclamation.

Preserve `models/champion/`, `data/snapshot.parquet`, `data/partitions.json`,
`docs/cp2-model-report.md`, `reports/cp2/`, `reports/cp10/`, the v1 public report and surfaces,
closed `delu-cp2`, and all existing evidence/landing tags. Preserve p = 0.948 and peak coverage
0.194 exactly as historical results. Never write new research into those artifacts.

AGENTS.md and engineering-role.md continue to govern roles, isolation, candidates and publication.
The owner authorized this task's plan replacement and directly necessary routing/state edits;
this is not a standing suspension for the Engineer. Builder is not Critic. A fresh Integration
verdict must bind the final candidate. **CP-3B item 6 was unmet and is not a precedent.**

## 2. The forecasting task and information boundary

Keep DE-LU hourly day-ahead prices as the target. A delivery date D contains its actual 23/24/25
canonical hours. Do not change the market, horizon, aggregation or target to improve a score.
Use the inherited v1 forecast-origin convention and eligibility contract. Record its exact
timezone, UTC instants and DST handling in the protocol; do not silently reinterpret “CET”.

Every predictor, normalization statistic and training target must have been available at its
historical forecast origin. Preserve the delivery-day masking test (exactly zero change) and
an available D-1 price mutation that moves an appropriate controlled forecast. Preserve refusal
of post-gate A69 and target-day actual columns. Preprocessing is part of this boundary.

For online forecast-error updates retain the conservative **complete delivery day D-2** release
rule, including 23/24/25-hour completeness. Consume each issued forecast/error pair once only.
Do not infer permission to use D-1 feedback from permission to use D-1 price predictors.
Report the delay as a policy restriction, not a universal claim about auction information.

## 3. Data and evidence class

CP-15 uses the existing development periods, folds 1–5, and their original eligible target hours.
All outputs are `development_post_selection`. Fold 3 may now inform exploratory comparison;
this is an explicit change from v20 and cannot make 2022 unseen again. No date-based crisis
feature or fold-specific model parameter is allowed. August 15–31 remains a reporting slice.

Do not read the spent v1 holdout or reserved tail outcomes for fitting, tuning or selection.
Filter admissible partitions before materializing model inputs. Reuse the existing admissible
historical predictor definitions, and add only causal transformations of those predictors here.
Every arm has the same information and target rows. Missing-model forecasts are failures, not
permission to shrink the common evaluation set. Declare exclusions inherited from v1 separately.

Warm-up forecasts must be genuine historical-origin forecasts from admissible pre-evaluation
history. Later observations can train subsequent daily models only after becoming available.
No in-sample fitted residuals masquerading as held-forward calibration errors. Report all data
cutoffs, row masks, hashes, fit/update counts and warm-up boundaries per fold and arm.

New-source research is read-only feasibility work in CP-15. No paid data purchase, data-license
change or deployment is authorized. Existing attribution and DATA-LICENSE.md remain controlling.
Do not use reanalysis as old forecast vintages, revised outages as as-of records, or 2024-only
weather to claim 2022 improvement. Check publication times for proposed cross-border inputs.

## 4. Adaptive representation

Compare forecasting the price directly with forecasting a normalized residual:
`z = (price - level) / scale`, then invert to EUR/MWh at the forecast origin.

For the fixed first comparison, level is the arithmetic mean and scale the sample standard
deviation of the preceding 168 available canonical hourly prices, ending at the inherited
D-1 boundary; scale floor is 1 EUR/MWh. Each training row uses its own historical-origin
statistics, never the evaluation origin's statistics or a full-series transformation.
Normalize price-valued lag predictors with that row's origin-level and scale as well; scale
price differences without subtracting the level. Freeze the unit mapping before comparison.
Other predictors retain the same definitions across paired arms, with any learned scaling fitted
on training data only. Do not delete or clip extreme target outcomes. The raw-price arm is the control.

This representation, updating and residual correction are hypotheses to test. Daily retraining
alone is neither assumed to solve the regime break nor assumed to reproduce v1's failure exactly.

## 5. CP-15 candidate set and bounded model choices

Pre-register the exact protocol in a candidate-branch commit **before model comparison runs**.
All following arms are required; letters are identifiers, not a predicted ranking.

| ID | Forecast policy | History |
|---|---|---|
| B0 | Existing similar-day naive | Inherited definition |
| B1 | Preserved v1 forecast vectors | Exact development replay, no refit |
| B2 | Daily rolling LEAR, raw target | Expanding from 2019-01-01, capped at 728 calendar days |
| B3 | Daily rolling LightGBM central forecast, raw target | Expanding from 2019-01-01, capped at 728 calendar days |
| A1 | B2 with §4 target normalization | Expanding from 2019-01-01, capped at 728 calendar days |
| A2 | B3 with §4 target normalization | Expanding from 2019-01-01, capped at 728 calendar days |
| A3 | Equal arithmetic mean of A1 and A2 central forecasts | Their histories |
| A4 | Normalized daily rolling LEAR | 84 calendar days |
| A5 | Equal arithmetic mean of A1, A2 and A4 central forecasts | Their histories |

Use LEAR's cross-hour price-lag and available exogenous-input structure; no new unavailable
feature can enter under its name. Select its regularization within the current training window
using chronological inner validation, identically for paired arms. Freeze the inner split and
finite penalty grid before comparison. Freeze one implementation and reproducible seed policy.
For B3/A2 use the inherited LightGBM p50 objective and CP-2 hyperparameters, with identical
parameters apart from the specified target transformation. No architecture or hyperparameter
search on outer-fold results. Explain any incompatibility before execution, rather than substitute.

For B2, B3, A1 and A2, use all admissible history from the later of 2019-01-01 or 728
calendar days before the forecast’s delivery day D, ending at the inherited availability boundary.
Apply this rule to evaluation and genuine warm-up forecasts alike. A4 uses precisely 84
preceding calendar days. Preserve minimum training-row sufficiency checks and every original
evaluation hour.

The 2019 start is deliberate: pre-2018-10-01 DE-AT-LU prices are a different market product.
No pre-2019 inputs are authorized. To count calendar days unambiguously, for a forecast
of delivery day D the long-history dates are `[max(2019-01-01, D - 728 calendar days), D)`
in the inherited market timezone, subject to the unchanged forecast-origin timestamp and
per-input availability filters. The exclusive right endpoint is the start of delivery day D;
it is not permission to use any observation unavailable when the forecast was issued.
A4 analogously uses `[D - 84 calendar days, D)`, subject to the same information boundary.
At early origins the long history expands; once the full 728 days are supported, it rolls.
Use this identical rule for the raw/normalized paired arms;
A3/A5 inherit their components’ histories. Do not extend A4 before 2019 to fill its window.

Predeclare minimum training-row sufficiency and require complete evaluation predictions.
An intentional boundary-limited long window is not itself a missing-history failure under
v21-r1. This does not excuse missing inputs within that window, insufficient eligible training
rows, unavailable row-specific normalization history, or an unsupported warm-up forecast.
Report any such remaining deficiency; do not silently shorten the authorized windows further
or drop a fold. Caching identical historical fits is permitted if cutoffs and identity are preserved.

Also perform a **Chronos-2 feasibility probe**, pinned to an exact public model revision, on
admissible training/inner-validation data only: load, memory/runtime and external-input support.
No required full-fold neural benchmark is disguised as completed by this probe. It informs the
next experiment; it cannot win CP-15. Likewise, produce a structural merit-order input feasibility
sheet covering fuel/EUA, load, renewables, capacity/outages, vintage, access, redistribution and
missingness. Do not implement a fuel layer or train a fundamental model in this checkpoint.

## 6. Common uncertainty comparison and point-error diagnosis

For every newly fitted policy and B0, build a common **rolling signed-residual distribution** from
the previous 28 complete delivery days whose issued errors are released by §2. Warm up that
buffer using genuine pre-evaluation predictions of the same policy; freeze the warm-up rule.
For normalized arms store `(actual - issued central forecast) / issued scale`; invert with the
current available scale. Raw arms use unscaled signed errors. Ensemble normalized arms share
the same current §4 scale. No retrospectively recomputed errors from a newly fitted model.

Report the original central forecast separately. The distribution's p50 is the central forecast
plus the buffer's median signed error; it is this final p50 that enters the primary MAE.
Emit quantiles {0.025, 0.10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 0.90, 0.975}. Freeze an empirical quantile
definition (including interpolation and ties) and exact fixtures before execution. This is an
empirical residual benchmark, **not** a finite-sample conformal coverage guarantee. B1 uses its
preserved final quantiles, with the same seven levels, and remains an immutable reference.

The method must produce finite, ordered quantiles without outcome-dependent clipping. Do not
invent extreme endpoints to obtain coverage. Freeze any final projection rule and score the
actual emitted vector. Report raw-central MAE, final-p50 MAE and the effect of residual centering.
Separate daily mean-level error, within-day shape error, signed bias, upper/lower misses, interval
width and post-shift recovery. Preserve aggregate metrics including all stress outcomes.

AgACI/PID and distributional neural methods are candidate directions for the next checkpoint;
they are not authorized additions to this fixed comparison. This first experiment establishes
whether better point forecasts and a simple rolling error model already change feasibility.

## 7. Scores, selection and uncertainty

Report per-fold MAE, RMSE, WIS, 50/80/95% coverage, mean/median/95th-percentile interval width,
miss counts by tail, missing predictions, fit/runtime and memory for every arm, including losers.
Report fold 3 and August 15–31 with their own dates and denominators, never interchange them.
WIS uses central intervals 50/80/95%, weights alpha/2 and median weight 1/2, normalized by 3.5.
Retain native v1 pinball in the historical record; do not rename a seven-quantile WIS as that score.

Define `S_MAE(m) = mean over five folds of MAE(m,f) / MAE(B0,f)`; similarly define S_WIS.
Use final p50 MAE. Freeze handling of a zero reference denominator: report the comparison as
undefined and request a protocol correction before selection; never divide by an arbitrary epsilon.
The equal fold weighting is deliberate so a crisis fold is not diluted by observation pooling.
Also publish pooled observation-weighted scores as secondary descriptions.

Rank A1–A5 by S_MAE, then S_WIS, then their table order for exact ties. Report the best observed
candidate even if none meets §8. Report separately the highest-ranked candidate meeting §8,
or `none`. No opportunistic replacement of the original CP-10 winner.

Provide dependence-aware uncertainty for paired daily losses using a seeded moving-block
bootstrap: resample 7-consecutive-delivery-day blocks within each fold, 2,000 replicates,
95% percentile intervals, identical resamples for paired models. Keep hourly observations
together. Report the 17-day peak descriptively with exact hit counts; flag its small effective
sample instead of an independent-hour significance claim. Any inferential statement here is
exploratory and subject to selection; no confirmatory p-value is claimed.

## 8. Product feasibility decision — distinct from Integration

These are owner-delegated engineering screening criteria, not literature guarantees or a claim
that we already know the achievable maximum. Apply them without changing them after results.

A1–A5 candidate m has `product_feasibility = DEMONSTRATED_ON_DEVELOPMENT` only if all hold:

1. S_MAE(m) is at most 0.90 times the lowest S_MAE among B0–B3.
2. S_WIS(m) is at most 0.90 times the lowest S_WIS among B0–B3.
3. Nominal 95% coverage is between 0.90 and 0.98 inclusive in **each** full fold.
4. On the matched August 15–31 slice, nominal 95% coverage is at least 0.90; both MAE and WIS
   are no worse than the corresponding best B0–B3 value on that same slice.
5. In every full fold, MAE and WIS are each no more than 1.05 times the corresponding best
   value among the rolling references B2/B3. This is a demanding per-period diagnostic comparator,
   not an implementable oracle being claimed as a deployed baseline.
6. Every eligible target has an issued forecast and finite ordered quantiles; no cherry-picked
   exclusions, suppressed failure days or altered target information.

Otherwise report `product_feasibility = NOT_DEMONSTRATED`, the failed criteria and actual values.
An Integration PASS can certify an honestly negative experiment. It **cannot** authorize freezing,
promotion or the claim that predictive quality is adequate. Put both verdicts at the top of the
report and terminal return. Do not spend time widening intervals to satisfy coverage in isolation.

## 9. Prospective product architecture, after feasibility

The eventual model of record is a **fixed forecasting policy with prescribed updates**: code,
feature contract, hyperparameters, initial state, fit schedule, delayed-error consumption and
failure policy are frozen. Parameter/state updates prescribed by that policy continue; discretionary
retuning or policy changes start a new evaluation. Timestamp forecasts before target revelation.
Measure the predictions that this same policy actually emits, including failures and staleness.

At a future freeze, record exact registry names, numeric versions, run IDs, initialization and
complete-artifact fingerprints. The later evaluator must resolve those versions from the registry,
verify fingerprints before opening outcome data, and refuse wrong/missing versions or altered
artifacts. No moving alias or local fallback substitutes for this read. Preserve per-origin input
vintages, state hashes and forecast lineage sufficient for replay. Test refusals with positive controls.

A future confirmatory horizon is at least 90 consecutive delivery days after policy freeze;
actual run and failure coverage must be reported. Scoring can consume released errors only under
the frozen update rule; the evaluator cannot tune on them. Final analysis rules and operational
metrics must be ratified before that stage starts. **No clock starts in CP-15.**

## 10. Programme sequence

| Checkpoint | Purpose | Authorization in this version |
|---|---|---|
| CP-15 | Adaptive point forecasting and common residual uncertainty; model/data feasibility probes | Complete bar below; execute only on receipt of its brief |
| CP-16 | One existing-input v2 central-blend/hour-aware-versus-pooled research experiment | Ratified v21-r3 §14 specification/checklist; CP-16 resumption authorized 2026-09-23 under §14.5; no promotion or later-stage authorization |
| CP-20 | Direct-GFS paired ablation: weather-augmented minus no-weather V2-H | Ratified v21-r4 §15; CP-20 execution and §15.7 immutable packaging authorized 2026-09-23; research only |
| CP-21 | Programme 4.5 on top of v3: HG plus a fixed three-block LightGBM member, compared with HG; adoption as v4 or a not-adopted branch under §17.6 | Ratified v21-r6 §17; CP-21 execution authorized 2026-09-29 under §17.11; research only |
| CP-22 | v4 revised: the three-block member replaced by one pooled member (R, then M), and a dynamic interval layer on the winner, compared with v4 under §20.6 | Ratified v21-r9 §20; CP-22 execution authorized 2026-10-01 under §20.11; research only |
| CP-23 | Programme 4.6 (4.6L → 4.6R → 4.6C): DDNN written in NumPy only; v5 = v4 plus a DDNN member at one third, compared with v4 under §21.6 | Ratified v21-r10 §21; execution requires the Owner's grant with the issued brief (§21.11); research only |
| CP-24 | DDNN-2 (§23): a literature-faithful DDNN in NumPy only, with day-level rows, a per-fold training-only search and an ensemble of tuned configurations, behind a pre-fold gate. v5 = (2/3)·HG + (1/6)·L + (1/6)·DDNN-2, compared with v4 under §23.9 in at most two scored attempts | Ratified v21-r11 §23; execution granted by the Owner's delegation of 2026-10-04 (§23.14); research only |
| CP-17 | Freeze the selected update policy and register verified initialization | Requires demonstrated feasibility and complete future bar |
| CP-18 | Run the same policy and build the live scorecard from recorded issued predictions | Requires operational and publication authorization |
| CP-19 | Evaluate the preregistered prospective policy | Requires CP-17 plus elapsed horizon and complete future bar |

Failure of CP-15 is a reason to reconsider modelling or information, not to continue to freeze.
Success does not automatically launch CP-16 or justify skipping stronger challengers. All v1
surfaces remain historical until the owner explicitly authorizes publication for a named task.

## 11. Execution resources and scope

Local Apple M3, 16 GB unified memory. Core comparison is CPU; an optional local MPS feasibility
probe is allowed with its device recorded. $0 expected external cost; the inherited $65/month
ceiling is not spending permission. Set bounded thread/memory use and report measured runtime.
Free public model downloads for the named feasibility probe are allowed after checking its
revision/license; no cloud jobs or subscriptions. No model/data upload, registry mutation,
remote experiment logging, push, PR, release, publication or mainline staging/commit is authorized.

Write new source under `src/cp15/`, driver `scripts/cp15_forecasting.py`, tests under
`tests/test_27_cp15_*.py` or `tests/cp15/`, research outputs under `reports/cp15/`, and verdicts
under `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-15/`. `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` may gain necessary pinned
dependencies. Reuse existing engineering code by import; do not modify preserved v1/CP-10 paths.
Large regenerated artifacts may live in a documented ignored cache with hashes and reproduction
commands; commit protocol, summary tables, manifests, report and review evidence.

## 12. Complete CP-15 acceptance checklist

1. Verify and report the starting state; preserve other sessions' work, v1/CP-10 evidence and
   restricted partitions; commit the exact v21 anchor and pre-run protocol before comparison.
2. Implement every B0–B3/A1–A5 policy in §5 and the common uncertainty construction in §6;
   prove genuine rolling fits, warm-up provenance and causal per-origin normalization with fixtures.
3. Prove §2 availability, D-2 feedback, single consumption, DST and schema refusal controls;
   each negative assertion has a positive control, including inherited live-namespace guards.
4. Produce predictions on identical original eligible hours and all metrics/diagnostics in §7
   for every arm; independently check counts, zero crossings, scores and exact window denominators.
5. Apply §7 ranking and every §8 criterion mechanically; report both Integration status and
   product_feasibility, best observed policy, qualified policy or none, and all failed criteria.
6. Deliver the pinned Chronos-2 feasibility probe and structural-input feasibility sheet in §5;
   document genuine access/resource limitations without inventing benchmark results or silently
   promoting probes into the candidate set. Such probe limitations do not block the core comparison.
7. Provide pinned reproduction commands, dependency/input/protocol hashes, seeds, chronological
   validation records, resource measurements and dependence-aware uncertainty; rerun relevant
   controls and the existing regression suite, reporting any blockers without a false PASS.
8. One fresh independent Integration Critic reviews a clean detached checkout of the exact
   final_candidate_sha, verifies every checklist item, independently recomputes saved-prediction
   metrics and performs causal control/representative fit reproduction; commit its verdict only
   after review. Record commands actually run, exit codes and limitations. No binding PASS means
   no terminal PASS. Candidate-to-evidence-tip changes are confined to this checkpoint's evidence.

## 13. Engineering Lead handoff

Read AGENTS.md, engineering-role.md and **this exact plan**, then the supplied CP-15 brief.
Do not read progress.md or orchestrator-role.md before Integration or use them for engineering.
Read engineering artifacts as needed within the information/partition boundary. Source literature
may inform implementation of the specified methods; it cannot expand the fixed candidate set.
The Orchestrator's research memo is not a competing plan or required engineering input.

Owner-authorized preparation files supplied with the brief are immutable inputs. On
`gauntlet/cp-15` only, the Lead may include the exact supplied `AGENTS.md`, `capstone_v21.md`
and brief bytes in its pre-run protocol candidate commit. The corrected rulebook must travel
with the plan because the CP-10 base commit predates its correction. This is narrowly authorized
packaging, not permission to edit governance or stage progress.md/orchestrator-role.md.
Verify the supplied rulebook and plan hashes; record the brief's hash before packaging.
Use a separate checkpoint worktree so the original CP-10 checkout is not switched or cleaned.
For the owner-authorized v21-r1 resumption, use the retained clean CP-15 worktree on
`gauntlet/cp-15` at `193d9cf48c586b9c4b1f43d7a5677b2d5f400832`, after verifying ownership
and state. The replacement brief supplies the exact revised plan and brief bytes for packaging
on that branch before comparison; the Lead may replace the branch’s working plan with those
exact bytes, but may not author further governance edits. Retain the original plan, protocol,
reports and FAIL verdict as historical evidence of attempt 1: their original committed identity
must remain reachable and any preserved copies must be byte-identical. Do not overwrite or
relabel the old verdict as a new review; if reusing the canonical verdict filename, first retain
the original unchanged at a distinct evidence path and record the mapping in the return.
No branch discard, tag, reclamation or mainline operation is authorized by resumption.
Keep one Git writer and the inherited fresh-Critic protocol. All work remains local.

Return PASS/BLOCKED/INCOMPLETE using the canonical §3 template, with product_feasibility beside
the engineering status, both terminal SHAs, verdict path, full checklist, elapsed time and branch/
worktree/tag accounting. Stop at that one return. Do not implement or plan later checkpoints.

Reasoning capture is active under AGENTS.md. The Lead names any interview-answer capture
trigger in one line in its terminal return; only the Orchestrator appends to the Q&A document.
This does not reopen Track A/C or permit the Lead to read or edit the document.

## 14. CP-16 — bounded existing-input v2 research experiment

**Complete specification/checklist remain ratified; CP-16 resumption authorized 2026-09-23.**
O1–O3 remain controlling except the expressly amended §14.5 cap/counting rule in v21-r3.
The resumption grant is recorded above. No new product gate is substituted for §8.

Forecast origin: **D−1 11:00 UTC (12:00 fixed UTC+01:00 CET)**; delivery dates/hours use
**Europe/Berlin**, including 23/24/25-hour days. Inputs retain the **2019-01-01** floor.
Complete released errors are from days **≤D−2**, consumed once under the inherited contract.

Delivery: a local research artifact evaluating both point and interval forecasts for the
Owner/technical reader, as an intermediate step toward the programme's live-system objective.
No commercial exposure, service-level, operational, economic-qualification or promotion claim.
The candidate scope is fixed; negative and mixed results are valid research outcomes.
The existing live-system objective and separate future-stage requirements remain unchanged.

The Lead owns routine engineering fields E1–E4 within this scope, without per-parameter
Owner decisions. It freezes the exact protocol before comparison; it cannot change a
scientific contrast, ceiling or quality rule after seeing results. Material changes or
insufficient allowances require an explicit report rather than silent scope reduction.

### 14.1 Policies, population and information

- **V2-H:** 50/50 mean of genuine issued A1/B2 **central** forecasts, plus the new hour-aware
  standardized signed-residual quantiles below. Do not average already calibrated p50s.
- **V2-P:** exactly the same central forecasts, scale, issued-error history, warm-up,
  target keys, quantile convention and failure policy; use the pooled residual quantiles.
  The only changed element is hour-aware pooling/shrinkage.
- **Saved references:** B0, B1, B2, A1; also B3 strictly to report all original §8 comparator
  conditions. No new B3 fit or new challenger. Preserve B1's calibrated/projected seven
  quantiles and original v1 nine-quantile pinball as distinct evidence.
- Compare all seven output policies on the original **10,747** target keys each:
  fold counts **2,160 / 2,159 / 2,112 / 2,160 / 2,156**. Successful complete output totals
  **75,229** policy-target rows. Five 90-calendar-day windows are
  2020-07-01..09-28, 2021-04-01..06-29, 2022-07-01..09-28,
  2025-05-01..07-29, and 2026-01-08..04-07. Full fold 3 has 2,112 hours/88 represented
  days; the peak is **2022-08-15..31, 408 hours/17 days**. Never interchange their denominators.
- Component recipes, 168-hour normalization, daily rolling fits and four-penalty chronological
  inner selection remain those in `reports/cp15/protocol.json`; long training history is
  `[max(2019-01-01,D−728 calendar days),D)`, subject to each origin's availability filter.
  No model/feature/penalty search beyond this inherited component procedure.
- Filter permitted partitions **before materializing inputs**. No spent holdout, reserved tail,
  added market history, post-gate A69, delivery-day actual predictors, or new source admission.
  Outer outcomes can enter later prescribed error updates only after the fixed release rule;
  they never tune the recipe. Preserve inherited A65 vintage-availability and historical
  data-revision assumptions as limitations, not new measured guarantees.

### 14.2 Causal residual construction and fallback

Owner-ratified recipe: for every genuinely issued blend forecast `c_t`, store
`r_t = (y_t − c_t) / s_t`, where `s_t` is **that issuance's** A1 scale: sample SD of the
168 then-available canonical prices, floored at 1 EUR/MWh. At issuance use the current
available `s_D`; never normalize old residuals with today's scale. Both arms use this
same convention, including B2's contribution to the blend.

Retain the most recent **28 complete released delivery days** of blend errors, all ≤D−2.
This inherits CP-15's complete-day convention; it can span more than 28 calendar dates
across gaps. Preserve both canonical repeated-hour observations on a 25-hour day, grouped
by their Europe/Berlin local hour; never synthesize the missing spring hour or deduplicate
UTC timestamps. Update each issued pair exactly once. Report buffer age and represented
calendar span as well as counts.

For each quantile `q` in `.025/.10/.25/.50/.75/.90/.975`, compute linear empirical quantiles
using the CP-15 `numpy.quantile(method=linear)` convention:

- `Q_P(q)`: all canonical hourly residuals in the shared buffer, equal observation weights.
- `Q_h(q)`: residuals from local hour h in that same buffer.
- `w_h = n_h / (n_h + 56)`, where `n_h` is the number of canonical errors at h.
  If h has fewer than **14 distinct complete delivery days**, set `w_h=0`.
- V2-H emits `c_D,h + s_D * [w_h Q_h(q) + (1−w_h) Q_P(q)]`;
  when `w_h=0`, use `Q_P` directly without evaluating an empty `Q_h`.
  V2-P emits `c_D,h + s_D * Q_P(q)`.

The fixed 56 pseudo-observation weight gives roughly one-third hour-specific contribution
at 28 errors/hour. It is a conservative regularization choice motivated by sparse tails,
**not an optimized value or a coverage guarantee**. Convex combinations of ordered quantile
functions preserve order. No tail clipping, isotonic repair or fixed-p50 reset is proposed;
both arms' final p50 includes their own residual median and must be scored as emitted.

Validate the one fixed recipe on a **training-only** admission slice: seven delivery dates
D0−8..D0−2 before each fold's first evaluation day D0. It is an implementation/support
check, not a score-selected configuration search. Freeze it before any new outer scoring;
if it cannot run causally or lacks support, return the deficiency rather than try a new
shrinkage value. These older dates are not claimed to be project-unseen evidence.

Generate/reuse genuine component forecasts from at most the preceding **60 calendar dates**
per fold, continuing daily through the evaluation end. This allowance includes the admission
slice and its own 28-day warm-up. Identify the required dates in E1 before fitting. No
in-sample residuals or hindsight-refitted predictions can fill the buffer. Cached component
forecasts are usable only with verified input/protocol/origin identity and independent
representative reproduction; a cache miss counts as a budgeted refit.

**Failure rule:** with fewer than 28 complete released forecast days, nonfinite component
output, missing required input or failed component fit, record failed issuance and its cause;
there is no stale-component, B0 or zero-error substitution. An incomplete new day cannot enter
the residual buffer; existing valid complete days may remain under the fixed 28-day rule.
Any lost original eligible target prevents a complete evaluation/PASS. Retain expected keys,
failed-row accounting and any explicitly partial summaries without inventing a full score or
silently shrinking denominators. The per-hour small-sample fallback is the pooled layer,
not a fallback for missing common history.

### 14.3 Metrics, diagnostics and causal controls

Re-score emitted p50 MAE and seven-quantile WIS with CP-15's interval weights alpha/2,
median weight 1/2, divisor 3.5; equally average the five fold ratios to B0. Preserve pooled
hour-weighted scores as secondary estimands. Also report all CP-15 §7 metrics: RMSE,
central versus emitted MAE, centering effect, 50/80/95% coverage and width summaries,
tail misses, bias, daily level/shape error, crisis recovery, failures, runtime and memory.
Report every original §8 criterion with actual values and limits, including B0–B3 and
rolling B2/B3 diagnostic comparators; old CP-15 results remain unchanged.

Report per-hour and exhaustive local-time blocks **night 22–05, solar 10–16, shoulder
06–09 plus 17–21**, with actual counts, represented dates, hits and widths. Owner-approved support
rule for block/hour uncertainty statements: at least **56 represented dates** within a fold;
below that, publish descriptive counts but label the comparison support-limited. This is a
reporting convention (two buffer lengths), not a power calculation or a new product gate.
Peak results remain descriptive because there are only 17 days. No demand for nominal-tail
accuracy is inferred from 28 per-hour errors.

Required controls, each with a positive control that can fail: delivery-day price mutation
changes forecasts by exactly 0.0; an available D−1 mutation moves a controlled forecast;
post-gate/target-actual rejection; D−1 error rejection versus D−2 released acceptance;
consume-once/idempotency, no partial-day buffer admission, 23/24/25-hour UTC identity,
row-specific scale and training-only transforms, genuine warm-up provenance, state persistence
and restart replay, stale/wrong cache refusal, expected-row completeness, finite ordered
quantiles, and common central/buffer parity across H/P. Include sparse-hour fallback and
linear-quantile/tie fixtures. Re-run applicable existing regression and live-namespace guards
without making a live mutation. Test execution and code inspection belong to the executing Lead
and Critic, not to this Orchestrator recording task.

### 14.4 Research conclusions and uncertainty — ratified O2 contract

Use seed **15042**, **2,000** paired noncircular **7-calendar-day** moving-block bootstrap
replicates within each full 90-date fold, concatenating/truncating to 90 dates. Resample
identically across policies, retaining all hours in each selected day and preserving missing
calendar dates as missing. Recompute both policy and B0 means within each resampled fold,
then equal-fold normalized score differences. Report 95% percentile intervals; never substitute
zero loss or epsilon for missing/zero denominators. An undefined replicate or comparison is
reported as unresolved uncertainty, not silently discarded/redrawn for a favorable result.

Primary contrast: **H−P** for S_WIS and S_MAE. Secondary contrasts: **H−B2** and **P−B2**
for those same scores. Per-fold paired daily-loss uncertainty remains descriptive. All
intervals are exploratory post-selection, without family-wise or confirmatory claims.

- Rank H/P descriptively by lower S_WIS, then S_MAE, then **P** on exact ties (simpler layer).
  Rank is not a statistically supported winner or a delivery decision.
- State **observed joint improvement** for a contrast only when the S_WIS difference's
  upper interval endpoint is <0 and the S_MAE difference's upper endpoint is ≤0.
  This zero-change reference tests improvement without inventing a tolerated point-loss margin.
- Mixed point/interval outcomes, intervals spanning zero or support failures produce
  **no demonstrated joint preference**, with both metrics shown; no post-hoc tradeoff weight.
  This is not proof of equivalence, absence of benefit or absence of harm. Report the
  direction, magnitude and uncertainty of mixed outcomes explicitly.
- Engineering completion is independent of gain. A complete valid negative comparison can
  earn Engineering PASS. Historical CP-15 remains NOT_DEMONSTRATED. A newly evaluated
  policy's original-§8 diagnostic is reported separately as met/not met/unassessed; under
  this research-only route it does not itself authorize promotion, CP-17 or publication.

No new economic calculation, decision optimizer, annualization or net-value gate is included.
Historical economics can be cited only with its original population, assumptions and
post-selection limitations. A material change to this approved economic scope requires Owner authorization and
a complete economic-policy contract before execution; do not insert a battery configuration as an unapproved default here.

### 14.5 Owner-approved numerical ceilings — v21-r3 resumption authorized

These are Owner-approved maximum allowances, **not spending targets, measured costs or
validated runtime estimates**. The CP-16 resumption grant is recorded above. Charge warm-up,
inner fits, controls, failures, corrections and independent reproduction to their applicable
counters under the rule below; carry forward every historical debit. Stop
on the first exhausted hard cap; retain evidence and return BLOCKED/INCOMPLETE as appropriate.
No model-quality-driven repeat, automatic retry, new family or automatic increase is allowed.

| Dimension | Approved total cap / counting unit |
|---|---|
| New output policies | **2**: H and P; **5** saved reference policies; **7** scored policies total |
| New residual configurations / selection trials | **1** hour-aware recipe + **1** fixed pooled control; **0** alternative residual configurations or outer-score selection trials |
| Central configurations / feature recipes | **2** inherited component configurations (A1/B2), **1** common inherited LEAR feature recipe with prescribed raw/normalized representations, **0** new feature recipes |
| Seeds / ensemble members | **1** inherited model seed, 42; **1** bootstrap seed, 15042; **2** fixed component members per output; **0** seed ensembles |
| Training-only residual admission | **7** interval-issuance dates × **5** folds × **2** output policies = **70** policy-days, within the replay allowance |
| Unique component forecast dates | At most **150** per fold (90 evaluation + 60 preceding) × **5** folds; **750** date-fold keys |
| Main component fitting | At most **1,500** component-day fitting attempts (750 × 2), cache hits require no new fit |
| Total component fitting, including controls/review/failures | **2,000** component-day attempts, including the 1,500 above; remaining **500** cover representative reproduction, controls and necessary defect repair, not a second full model comparison |
| Primitive estimator fits / inherited selection | **240,000** Lasso fit attempts total: 2,000 × 24 hours × (4 inner penalties + 1 final refit). At most **192,000** inner-penalty trials and **48,000** final hourly refits, both subsets of that total. Early failure still counts; a smaller fixture does not create extra attempts. |
| Residual replay / regeneration | At most **6** full-equivalent H/P passes, **9,000** cumulative policy-days total (750 × 2 × 6), including admission, diagnostics, controls, corrections and independent review; **0** extra scored recipes |
| Saved-reference processing | At most **3** metric-only complete passes across **5** saved reference policies; **0** B0/B1/B3 model refits or new reference calibration |
| Bootstrap / uncertainty | **1** joint 2,000-replicate index set for planned contrasts per analysis pass; at most **3** analysis passes including independent verification; no seed search |
| Compute | **24 machine-hours**, aggregate elapsed execution time of all compute jobs on this one local machine, summed across simultaneous jobs; includes tests/reproduction and failed jobs, excludes human idle time; **4** CPU workers maximum, BLAS threads **1**, **0** GPU/cloud jobs |
| Active human/agent effort | Approximate checkpoint timebox **32 hours**; separate hard ceiling **40 active hours**, including protocol, implementation, corrections and review. No unlimited extension at the approximate timebox. |
| Memory / storage | **10 GiB** aggregate process-tree resident memory; **20 GiB** additional disk including worktrees, environments, caches and outputs; **0 bytes** of new dataset/model downloads |
| Other work / cost | **0** new sources/providers, weather probes, neural candidates, VRE fits, recombination searches, economic runs, operational days, automated schedules or remote mutations; **$0** external cost |

**Forward-looking counting rule — Owner-ratified v21-r3, 2026-09-23.**

Purely synthetic fixture and state tests, which use no real research data, are charged to
the compute, memory, storage and effort ceilings but not to the policy-day counter.

Forecast/state replay using real research data remains charged to the policy-day counter
using the existing policy-day unit, including warm-up, controls, failed attempts and
independent reproduction. Calling a replay a “test” does not exempt it.

Model fitting remains charged to the existing component-day and primitive-fit counters.
This amendment neither changes those units nor creates an additional policy-day charge for
each primitive estimator fit. Real-data replay performed alongside fitting still incurs its
applicable replay charge.

The historical **3,730** debit stands in full under its original accounting basis and is not
re-scored under this rule. The revised cumulative ceiling therefore leaves **5,270** policy-days
for subsequent work under the revised counting rule. Every other resource debit is preserved.
This change is forward-looking. It does not retroactively establish compliant accounting or
monitoring, and it grants no reset. The allowance is a maximum, not a spending target or a
guarantee of feasibility.

**Resumption conditions.** Before further experimental execution, the Lead checks that all
remaining work fits the revised accounting and every other remaining allowance, and reports
the estimate, including admission, production, necessary controls and independent verification.
Historical monitoring gaps remain disclosed. Regenerate evidence from inadequately monitored
work wherever it is required to support scored results or acceptance criteria. Preserve the
original evidence and its limitations; later monitoring does not prove historical compliance.
Preserve the existing candidate branch, evidence, independent FAIL verdict and all debits;
resume the existing checkpoint, without discarding it or restarting from scratch. The Lead
owns feasibility, resource allocation, monitoring repairs and independently verified completion
within this scope; these are execution responsibilities, not further Owner parameter decisions.
The required independent Integration review and complete acceptance criteria remain unchanged;
no scientific result is inferred from the interrupted attempt. Weather admission under
programme §4.1 is not a prerequisite for this resumption.

The fit counts are arithmetic envelopes from the inherited 24-hour/four-penalty recipe,
not a claim that every origin needs refitting or that the caps suffice. E1 must enumerate
actual origins and count primitive calls before launch. If adequate genuine warm-up or required
verification cannot fit within these limits, return a scoped blocker; do not drop hours,
change history or spend an unstated allowance. Distinct caps are simultaneous, not additive.
The Lead chooses work decomposition and how to allocate the totals; no fixed review-round
count is imposed. Corrections require disclosure, preserved invalid evidence and a fresh
exact-candidate review; they do not permit outcome-guided scientific tuning.

### 14.6 Engineering completion fields — Lead-owned, no new Owner ballots

| ID | Field to freeze under the adopted scope | Completion rule |
|---|---|---|
| **E1 — ENGINEERING PRE-RUN** | Exact permitted partition/key manifest, seven-day admission dates, ≤60-day warm-up dates, cache identity, fit/replay counts and missing-data feasibility | Resolve from metadata and permitted training data before comparison; verify support and totals against §14.5. Missing cache is not authority for extra fits. |
| **E2 — ENGINEERING PRE-RUN** | Dependency/code/input hashes, numerical fixtures/tolerances, output schema and exact reproduction commands | Pin inherited recipes and the approved H/P procedure; training-only validation, no new outer-score selection. Refuse discrepancies rather than silently changing the scientific contract. |
| **E3 — ENGINEERING PRE-RUN** | Resource instrumentation, preflight disk/RAM availability, cutoff/abort implementation and atomic evidence saves | Establish how all attempts/jobs count against caps before the first fit; exceeding a cap cannot be hidden by restarting a process. |
| **E4 — ENGINEERING REVIEW IDENTITY** | Lead session identity and a fresh independent Integration Critic's session identity; exact final candidate SHA and detached worktree | Accountable executor is the **Track B Engineering Lead for CP-16**; reviewer is its **independent CP-16 Integration Critic**. The Lead assigns the actual sessions under its role; the Orchestrator does not launch them. Reviewer independence and identities must be recorded, not invented in 4.0a. |

E1–E4 belong to the Lead within the approved scope and ceilings. Complete the prescribed
pre-run feasibility/accounting checks before their dependent fits/comparison. Report a
material scope change or insufficient allowance explicitly; do not return routine engineering
parameters to the Owner for approval or silently weaken the experiment to fit a ceiling.

### 14.7 Paths, isolation and immutable inputs

| Purpose | Authorized CP-16 path envelope |
|---|---|
| New engineering namespace, tests and driver | `src/cp16/`, `tests/cp16/`, `scripts/cp16_v2.py`; exact internal organization belongs to the Lead |
| Dependency consistency if needed | `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`; inherit existing stack by default, no model/data downloads |
| Durable protocol and lineage | `reports/v2-causal/protocol.json`, `input-manifest.json`, `lineage.json`, `artifact-manifest.json` |
| Durable experiment outputs | `reports/v2-causal/predictions.parquet`, `metrics.csv`, `diagnostics.csv`, `uncertainty.csv`, `criteria.csv`, `failures.csv`, `resources.json`, `report.md`, `reproduce.md` |
| Independent evidence and terminal return | `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-16/integration.md`, other review evidence within `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-16/`, `checkpoint-return.md` in that directory |
| Checkpoint-local ignored material | `.local/worktrees/cp-16/`, `.local/artifacts/cp-16/`, `.local/tmp/cp-16/`; no sole copy of required evidence here |
| Supplied immutable governance packaging | Exact ratified `capstone_v21.md`, named amendment record, `docs/track-b/cp-16-v2-brief.md`; only expressly authorized byte-for-byte inclusion on the isolated candidate branch |

Preserve `src/cp15/`, `reports/cp15/`, prior evidence, v1 models/data/report/public surfaces,
all other locked documents, Q&A and unrelated pending work. Reuse by import/read without
altering them. All outputs are local. The disposable branch is **`gauntlet/cp-16`**,
retained for this authorized resumption, declared with its worktrees in the return.
Only the Lead writes checkpoint Git history. No branch/worktree/tag is created during this recording task.

The Owner authorized CP-16 resumption on its existing candidate branch, including local
candidate/evidence commits and byte-for-byte packaging of the supplied v21-r3 anchor,
`docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r2-to-v21-r3-amendments.md` and issued CP-16 brief. Preserve the
previous immutable documents in the existing commit history. The Lead may not author locked
documents, amend its own bar, copy unrelated pending work or stage `progress.md`. This scoped
suspension ends at the Orchestrator's return and does not transfer to the Lead; the resumption
grant persists within §14.5, the issued brief and engineering-role boundaries.

### 14.8 Complete CP-16 acceptance checklist

Every item is mandatory. Engineering PASS does not require a positive research finding; it
does require a complete valid evaluation and fresh binding Integration PASS.

1. Verify actual repository/input state and preserve other sessions' work and all v1/CP-15
   evidence. Commit the exact ratified amendment, execution brief and complete pre-run protocol
   on the authorized CP-16 candidate branch before new model comparison; document input,
   code, dependency, budget and protocol identities and all permitted origin/target keys.
2. Implement only the fixed A1/B2 central blend, the frozen causal hour-aware residual policy
   and the otherwise identical pooled control. Freeze the two constructions on permitted
   training data before outer scoring; prove that their only difference is hour-aware pooling.
3. Prove origin availability, training-only and origin-specific transforms, D−2 release,
   consume-once, genuine warm-up, complete-day/DST identity, sparse-hour fallback, cache
   identity and restart replay, with negative assertions accompanied by positive controls.
   Preserve relevant inherited namespace guards and all prohibited-partition boundaries.
4. Produce forecasts for every original eligible target in all five folds; report exact
   shared key counts, failed issuance and original exclusions, all finite ordered quantiles
   and emitted p50 separately from central. No missing eligible forecasts, altered targets
   or silently reduced denominators can support completed-evaluation PASS.
5. Independently verify emitted-vector scores, original seven-quantile WIS and equal-fold B0
   normalization, all required per-fold/hour/block/peak diagnostics and their denominators.
   Re-score saved B0/B1/B2/A1 references and B3's diagnostic comparisons without new fits or
   overwriting historical evidence. Keep native v1 pinball separate.
6. Apply the frozen research ranking/paired uncertainty/no-preference rule mechanically,
   report both point and interval effects including negative or mixed findings, and report
   all six unchanged original §8 diagnostics. Distinguish Engineering status, historical
   CP-15 product status, new research findings and product/delivery eligibility. No demonstrated
   joint preference is not equivalence or absence of benefit; disclose mixed effects. No post-hoc
   economic threshold or research-to-product promotion is permitted.
7. Enforce and report every adopted numeric resource/candidate cap, counting warm-up, inner
   selection, failed attempts, controls, corrections and independent reproduction. At the
   first exhausted cap retain partial evidence and return the appropriate non-PASS status;
   no unauthorized scope reduction or resource extension can cure an incomplete checklist.
8. Supply durable protocol, lineage, predictions, metrics, diagnostics, uncertainty, failure/
   resource logs, notices, reproducibility manifest and executable reproduction commands.
   Run relevant controls and regression checks; disclose defects/repairs and invalidated
   outputs. All development results retain their post-selection label and inherited limits.
9. Obtain one fresh independent Integration-Critic PASS on a clean detached checkout of
   the exact final candidate, covering this entire checklist, independently recomputed
   saved-prediction metrics and representative causal/component/state reproduction. Preserve
   commands, exit codes and limits; no self-certification or unsupported PASS.
10. Return the complete canonical checkpoint packet, both terminal SHAs and a verdict-only
    candidate-to-evidence delta, reachable evidence, branch/worktree/tag accounting, elapsed
    effort and all resource totals. End at CP-16's local result, including an honest negative
    result; no next checkpoint, final live-policy selection, publication or mainline operation.

### 14.9 Entry authority and terminal boundary

The Owner ratified the v21-r3 cap/counting change and authorized CP-16 resumption on
2026-09-23, including its consistent successors. Read `AGENTS.md`, `engineering-role.md`,
this exact ratified revision and `docs/track-b/cp-16-v2-brief.md`. The complete §14.8 checklist
controls; CP-15's §12 is not the CP-16 bar. Preserve the role's information-isolation rules.

Use the approximate 32-hour timebox and all §14.5 hard ceilings; report elapsed hours to the
nearest half hour and active/compute effort separately. Stop at the first exhausted cap,
retain partial evidence and return PASS/BLOCKED/INCOMPLETE under templates §3 as applicable.
A missing required forecast/review cannot support PASS. No automatic additional family,
comparison, budget extension, next-checkpoint planning, mainline action or publication.
Reasoning-capture triggers are named by the Lead in its return; it does not edit Q&A.


## 15. CP-20 — direct-GFS paired research ablation (v21-r4 ratified)

**Ratified and separately authorized for CP-20 execution, 2026-09-23.** Owner approves the
revised three-feature specification and all §15.5 ceilings, including 120 aggregate machine-hours.
Owner D1/D3 select research only; D2 fixes the comparator and endpoint rule below.
This issuance records authority and identities only; the approved scientific and resource
requirements are unchanged. The task-scoped recording suspension ends at the Orchestrator's
terminal return and grants no Lead authority to edit governance. CP-17–19 retain their roles and are not opened. This is programme 4.4D,
not VRE modelling, product qualification, an economic experiment or prospective operation.

### 15.1 Inheritance, population and arms

Inherit §§14.1–14.4 unchanged for original target keys/folds, component training/selection,
normalization, chronology, H residual construction, metrics/diagnostics, bootstrap mechanics
and evidence labels, except the explicitly replaced arms, weather treatment and contrasts
here. Inherit §§2–3, all six §8 diagnostics and §9 restrictions. Preserve historical CP-15/16
results, FAILs, debits and limits. §14 remains the unchanged historical CP-16 contract.

- **H0:** no-weather V2-H exactly as §14.2: inherited A1/B2 50/50 central blend and H layer.
- **HG:** the same A1/B2 recipes with only the §15.2–15.3 weather columns appended to each
  hourly regressor; same 50/50 central blend, price-only A1 scale, H recipe and failure rules.
  Each arm uses its own genuinely issued central errors, but identical buffer dates,
  release/support/update rules. Do not share residual values across different forecasts.
- Same histories, eligible rows, chronological four-penalty selection procedure, numerical
  settings and fixed seed 42; selected penalties may differ because inputs differ. No extra
  interaction, lag, feature subset, blend weight or residual tuning. No pooled-P arm here.
- Reuse identity-verified H0/component caches and five saved B0/B1/B2/B3/A1 references;
  independent representative H0 reproduction must match accepted CP-16 vectors. HG components
  must be fitted with their own causal weather inputs, not relabelled cached no-weather fits.
- Both arms cover exactly §14.1's **10,747** keys (including fold 5 through **2026-04-07**):
  **21,494** contrast rows; with five saved references, **75,229** scored rows. Preserve
  original exclusions; missing weather never removes a target or shortens price history.
- Freeze the existing CP-16 input-manifest's **638 fold/date origins**, 35 training-only
  admission dates and genuine warm-up (2020-05-25 / 2021-02-23 / 2022-05-25 / 2025-03-22 /
  2025-12-02). No earlier warm-up search. The §14.2 60-date limit remains an outer bound.

### 15.2 Admitted source, conversion and one weather recipe

Use only operational **GFS 0.25° D−1 00 UTC** via the dossier's NCAR d084001 / NOAA AWS
endpoints. Admission is accepted for the inventoried scope under its disclosed assumptions:
NCAR-only field presence is inferred from file integrity/size plus sampled version layouts;
public availability before D−1 11:00 UTC is **reconstructed availability**, not a daily-delivery
guarantee. NCEP completion averages do not independently establish public dissemination lag.
Carry these assumptions, known endpoint defects, source fingerprints and the post-sample
radiation-precision-check disclosure into protocol/report. Admission does not certify live use.
ICON remains NOT_ADMITTED and is excluded. No reanalysis, hindcast, later cycle or pre-2019 input.

The dossier inventoried 2,468 runs using CP-15 warm-up. This CP-16-style warm-up requires
**2,476** unique runs: the extra **2023-03-24..31** eight runs must receive targeted GFS
field/lead/availability checks before fitting. Do not label them already admitted. Verify
actual field metadata during extraction, including previously inferred NCAR fields; a material
contradiction to admission or unsupported version/units stops the task with evidence.

Freeze this single conversion before fitting or scoring:

1. Decode u/v at **10 m and 100 m above ground** (m/s) and surface **DSWRF** (W/m²).
   Pressure levels never substitute for above-ground heights. Validate init/valid time,
   grid, forecast status and version per message. Needed endpoints are f021,024,…,048.
   Use the inventoried endpoint; for added runs use AWS first. At most one same-product
   alternate-endpoint attempt per failed object; compare metadata, retain hashes and defects.
2. Wind: linearly interpolate each component between bracketing three-hour endpoints to
   canonical delivery-hour starts **h22–h46**, with no extrapolation. Then compute
   **sqrt(u²+v²) per grid cell**, separately at **10 m and 100 m**, before spatial averaging.
   Radiation: at each grid
   point recover three-hour means from documented six-hour-reset averages: use A(L−3,L)
   directly at L≡3 mod6, otherwise **2A(L−6,L)−A(L−6,L−3)** at L≡0 mod6. Assign the block
   mean to each constituent hour [h,h+1); no solar-shape disaggregation or extra interpolation.
   Validate actual averaging bounds, not lead number alone. For negative block means, permit
   only values ≥−3q, q=max packing quantum of contributing messages; clip those to zero
   before aggregation and log count/magnitude/version. Below −3q or unknown quantum/bounds
   is a conversion failure, not a fitted tolerance. Disclose coarse v14/v15 precision.
3. Use the fixed rectangular proxy **47–55.25°N, 5.5–15.5°E**, inclusive grid centres,
   cosine(latitude) area weights normalized over that fixed grid. Apply them to the per-cell
   wind-speed magnitudes at each height and to converted DSWRF, separately per hour. Mean
   wind speed is the weighted mean of cell speeds, not the magnitude of mean u/v.
   No power curve, capacity weights, learned geographic mask, VRE conversion or provider search. Call it
   a regional weather proxy, not an exact DE-LU polygon or power-generation forecast.
   Do not renormalize over missing cells. Nonfinite required support makes the weather vector
   missing under §15.3. Store grid/weights, units and conversion fingerprints.
4. Append only **three same-target-local-hour weather columns** to each A1/B2 hourly design:
   **mean wind speed at 10 m, mean wind speed at 100 m, mean DSWRF**. Inherited imputation
   adds their **three missing indicators**. The five native extraction fields remain
   **u10, v10, u100, v100 and DSWRF**. No cross-hour expansion or feature search.
   On repeated local hours average the two canonical weather vectors as the inherited LEAR
   local-hour design does; preserve both canonical outputs/targets. A missing spring hour
   remains absent. Require all repeated-hour inputs or mark the local-hour vector missing.

### 15.3 Missing-input and transform rule

Weather for **delivery 2019-01-01 is structurally missing** because its run would be
2018-12-31; do not import it or remove its otherwise eligible training row. For any confirmed
missing/late/nonfinite weather vector after the bounded endpoint attempts, set all three
derived weather columns missing and mark all three indicators. Apply the inherited CP-15 LEAR
imputer/scaler: per-feature **training-partition median**, all-null column → 0, missing
indicator per feature, then training-only StandardScaler. Fit them independently inside each
inner-training split and final training window; never use validation/outer outcomes or future
weather to impute. No interpolation across dates, forward fill or zero-radiation shortcut.
This is the same rule in training, admission, warm-up and evaluation. HG still emits its own
fitted-component/H forecast; it does not switch silently to H0 or borrow H0's residuals.

Complete the required extraction/status ledger before fitting: classify structural missing,
confirmed archive absence, documented lateness and invalid support separately. Failed/unattempted
retrieval due to exhausted resources, absent admission evidence or unknown schema is **BLOCKED**,
not missing-data imputation. Confirmed missing weather is an explicit part of the HG policy;
report dates/counts and all-imputed origins, not an unqualified complete-weather claim.
Price/load/component/state failures retain §14.2's failure rule; weather fallback cannot cure
insufficient common history, an invalid fit or a missing eligible forecast. Freeze the recipe,
conversion fixtures and complete missingness manifest before any fit/outer scoring.

### 15.4 Comparison and claims

The sole primary contrast is **HG − H0**, for each paired equal-fold normalized score.
Use §14.4's seed 15042, one shared 2,000-replicate seven-calendar-day block index set per
analysis pass and its exact paired score-difference/95% percentile procedure. Apply
**upper CI(ΔS_WIS)<0 AND upper CI(ΔS_MAE)≤0** to those differences, not to marginal-score
intervals or point estimates. Otherwise report **no demonstrated joint preference**, with
mixed outcomes/undefined intervals explicit; never equivalence or absence of benefit/harm.
If descriptive ordering is reported, lower S_WIS then S_MAE, with H0 on exact ties; it is not
promotion. Original §8 diagnostics are unchanged for both arms, with saved B0–B3 comparators.
Keep all §14.3 per-fold/hour/block/peak diagnostics and §14.4 scientific limitations.
All results are **development_post_selection**. Historical economics is descriptive only;
zero new economic runs/thresholds. Negative results complete valid research; no result opens
VRE, CP-17–19, public surfaces, live selection or a prospective clock.

### 15.5 Owner-approved ceilings — CP-20 execution authorized

**D4 approved, 2026-09-23:** 120 aggregate machine-hours; all other caps below approved as
drafted. These are **CP-20-specific** ceilings, not feasibility guarantees, estimates or targets.
The Lead retains the existing pre-run feasibility responsibility. No transfer of CP-16's unspent allowance
or reset of its 6,458 policy-days/other debits. Report prior-task totals separately from new
CP-20 increments. Use §14.5's counting units and forward-looking synthetic-test/real-replay/fit
distinctions unchanged. Charge preparation, failures, warm-up, controls, repairs and independent
review to applicable caps. Stop before the first exhausted cap and retain partial evidence.

| Dimension | Owner-approved maximum |
|---|---|
| Policies/configurations | **2** arms, **5** saved references, **7** scored policies; **1** weather feature/conversion/missingness recipe, **1** fixed H recipe; **2** inherited A1/B2 component recipes per arm; **2** components/blend, weight 1/2; **0** additional ensembles/configurations/outer-selection trials |
| Seeds/inner selection | Fixed fitting seed **42**, bootstrap seed **15042**; no seed search; **4** inherited penalties per hourly fit, same chronological inner split/tie rule |
| Dates/main fits | **638** fold/date origins/arm, **35** admission dates/arm within those, ≤**60** warm-up dates/fold; **3,000** main component-day attempts across both arms (contains cache misses; nominal all-fresh need 2×638×2=2,552) |
| All fitting | **4,000** component-day attempts total; **480,000** primitive Lasso attempts: ≤**384,000** inner and ≤**96,000** final refits (4,000×24×(4+1)); retries/solver continuations count, not extra recipes |
| Replay | **9,000** new policy-days total; ≤**6** full-equivalent paired passes (conservative envelope 750×2×6); actual reused/recomputed real-data state work charged under §14.5 |
| References/uncertainty | **3** metric-only full reference passes; **3** bootstrap analysis passes including independent review, **2,000** replicates each; **0** new B0/B1/B3 fits/reference calibration |
| Weather/extraction | **1** product, **2** named access endpoints; **2,476** unique 00 UTC runs; **5** fields×**10** leads/run (≤**123,800** target messages); **3** decode/extraction attempts per target message including retries/review; **160 GiB** cumulative new transfer including metadata, dependencies, failed/duplicate requests; **0** whole global multi-field run-file downloads or unrelated data/model downloads |
| Compute/effort | **120 aggregate machine-hours** including network/extraction jobs, summed across concurrent jobs; **4** workers, BLAS **1**, **0** GPU/cloud; approximate **64-active-hour** timebox, hard **80 active hours** including verification/return |
| Memory/storage/cost | **10 GiB** aggregate process-tree RSS; **40 GiB** additional peak disk including environments/worktrees/cache/evidence; **$0**; inherited admission cache (~1.73 GiB) measured as retained baseline, not deleted or hidden |
| Other work | **0** ICON/VRE/neural candidates, feature/recombination searches, new economic runs, operational days, schedules or remote mutations |

Rationale: the dossier estimates ~101 GiB of target-message payload and ~55 sequential NCAR
hours plus 7–22 AWS hours. Transfer/compute margins cover indexes, failures and review; they do
not prove feasibility. Stream verified messages to bounded regional artifacts; retain original
sample raw files, per-message hashes/URLs and reproducible acquisition records. Do not retain
~101 GiB of globals under a 40 GiB disk cap. No unverified NCSS shortcut is included.
Before dependent work, the Lead completes §14.6 E1–E4 for **CP-20**, estimating extraction,
admission, production, controls and independent verification against every cap. Insufficient
allowance/material discrepancy returns a concrete blocker, not a new unapproved recipe.

### 15.6 Complete CP-20 acceptance checklist

All ten items are mandatory. They inherit the verification standard of §14.8; the weather
additions and H0/HG scope replace CP-16-specific H/P wording, not its scientific safeguards.

1. Verify repository/input state, retain prior evidence and other-session work; after Owner
   ratification/execution grant only, package exact supplied anchor/amendment/brief and commit
   the frozen protocol/input/conversion/missingness/budget manifests before comparison.
2. Close the eight-run admission extension; validate all extracted field/lead/version metadata,
   source/endpoint identity and historical availability basis. Preserve inferred versus decoded
   evidence, 2019 structural missingness and all dossier exceptions; record every extraction gap.
3. Implement exactly H0/HG and the frozen conversion/fallback; show only the predefined weather
   treatment differs. Verify H0 against accepted CP-16 vectors and reproduce representative
   weather-component fits. Training-only admission must precede outer scoring; no tuning to gain.
4. Prove §14.8 item 3's causal/state/DST/cache controls, plus positive/negative weather-origin,
   accumulation, units, packing/clipping, aggregation and missingness controls. Verify pre-2019
   refusal and independent reconstruction from retained raw samples without rerunning admission.
5. Produce all original eligible keys for both arms and the required reference metrics; no
   denominator changes. Independently verify emitted p50/ordered vectors, all §14.3 diagnostics
   and support counts, including fallback incidence; inherited failures still preclude PASS.
6. Apply HG−H0 paired endpoint rule and all six original §8 diagnostics; keep point/interval
   effects, uncertainty, negative/mixed findings, post-selection labels and research/product
   distinctions. No promotion, economic threshold or claim of guaranteed availability/coverage.
7. Enforce/report every §15.5 cap from the first job, all attempts and independent review;
   preserve historical debits/monitoring limitations. Exhaustion yields BLOCKED/INCOMPLETE,
   never implicit permission to impute unfinished extraction or shrink evaluation.
8. Supply protocol, lineage, decoded weather/features, predictions, metrics/diagnostics,
   uncertainty, criteria, failure/resource logs, rights notices and executable reproduction
   commands; preserve invalid outputs/repairs and run relevant inherited regression guards.
9. Obtain **one fresh independent Integration-Critic PASS** binding the exact final candidate
   in a clean detached checkout and this entire checklist, with independent saved-vector
   metrics/paired uncertainty and representative conversion/component/causal/state reproduction.
10. Return canonical packet, final candidate and evidence-tip SHAs, evidence-only terminal
    delta, reachable history, all resources and branch/worktree accounting; stop at CP-20's
    local result. No mainline action, publication, later checkpoint or executor self-ratification.

### 15.7 Paths and entry authority

Under the recorded CP-20 execution authorization: `src/cp20/`, `tests/cp20/`,
`scripts/cp20_weather.py`, `reports/weather-ablation/`, `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-20/`,
`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` if necessary; ignored material under `.local/{worktrees,artifacts,tmp}/cp-20/`.
Use admitted files read-only from `reports/weather-admission/` and `.local/weather-admission/`;
put extended inventories/extraction evidence in `reports/weather-ablation/`. Preserve CP-15/16
code, reports, data, model registries, public surfaces, Q&A, progress and all other locked files.
Include the exact accepted `reports/weather-admission/` bundle and intake receipt in the
candidate when absent from its base; preserve their manifest identity, without revising them.

Accountable executor: CP-20 Engineering Lead; reviewer: its fresh independent Integration
Critic under `engineering-role.md`. The Owner separately authorizes local
`gauntlet/cp-20` candidate/evidence commits and exact immutable packaging of this ratified
anchor, `docs/track-b/capstone_v21-r3-to-v21-r4-amendments.md` and
`docs/track-b/cp-20-direct-weather-brief.md`, together with the admission package above.
Ratification and CP-20 execution authority are **GRANTED, 2026-09-23**. The Lead owns the
existing pre-run checks, including feasibility and the eight added GFS runs; no further Owner
approval is needed unless a concrete blocker exceeds this scope. No scientific/budget change,
later checkpoint, governance edit, mainline operation or publication is authorized.


## 16. Final-product lifecycle — Owner amendment, v21-r5

### 16.1 Selection, freeze, rollout and evaluation are distinct

When the Owner designates an exact version as final, record that version as the selected
product and the mandatory target of the product panel, primary demo and daily operation.
One policy/version must serve all four roles at completed rollout. A research leader or
new experiment does not replace it automatically. An incoming selection with unfinished
prerequisites remains explicitly selected/pending; do not claim it runnable or relabel the
old demo. The previous product remains identified honestly until the replacement works.

Complete the admitted development and protected unused-data comparison, record the final
selection and qualification disposition, then execute authorized CP-17 freeze and CP-18
operation. Owner designation is a product decision, not statistical proof or permission to
skip those gates. No model, including current HG or immutable v1, is designated by this text.
The §8 historical failed criteria and research evidence classes are unchanged.

### 16.2 What freezes and what updates every day

Freeze code and dependencies, algorithm/architecture, feature and source-availability
contracts, hyperparameters, training-window and label-delay rules, initial artifact/state,
randomness, refit schedule, uncertainty/calibration updates, scoring/decision rules and failure
policy. Store numeric registry versions and initialization fingerprints as §9 requires.

For the selected final product, **daily retraining, eligible input refresh and forecast
issuance are required on every delivery day**. Each successful fit produces a versioned
artifact with its training window, available labels, seed, timestamps and parent/input/state
hashes. Use only information available at the fixed origin. Daily fitting changes weights/state
within the frozen policy, not the adopted generation; discretionary tuning or changing that
policy requires a new freeze and evaluation. Never overwrite an issued forecast after outcomes.

The future brief fixes numeric origin/deadlines, windows, resource ceilings and the exact
meaning of a successful daily fit before the fresh-data replay/final freeze. Input refresh,
residual-state maintenance or TabPFN context replacement alone is not weight training. A
candidate unable to meet daily retraining within admitted licensing/resources needs an explicit
Owner-approved exception specifying its real update mechanism and public wording before live
admission; no alternative cadence or exemption is silently inferred from model family.
Immutable historical v1/reference artifacts remain untouched; this requirement does not
retroactively retrain them or force every research comparator to train daily.

Daily operation covers all delivery days, including DST. The operational brief supplies an
explicitly authorized unattended schedule and incident/fallback policy. Publication authority,
operator ownership, monitoring, permissions and resources must be settled before launch. This
amendment creates no automation or standing authority to publish externally.

For missing inputs/labels, failed training, resource exhaustion or source outage, apply the
frozen fallback/staleness limits or record failed issuance. Display a failed/skipped fit as
such, even if a valid fallback produces a forecast. Do not count retained weights as a new
successful training run or backfill a late forecast as timely. Failures remain in the record.

### 16.3 What the product and demo expose

The product panel comes first, followed by How the product works, scientific Product results,
Business insights, How the models compare and all remaining sections in their existing order.
[PUBLISH_RULES 1.1](docs/PUBLISH_RULES.md) §§5, 5.1a, 7.2 and A8 define presentation acceptance.
The twelve-subject product coverage follows the actual final policy and its dated artifacts;
the outgoing product's evidence stays historical. The primary demo uses the same product policy,
and identifies the artifact/issue date and whether an interaction is a counterfactual scenario.
An old replay may remain as labelled history, not as a different primary product.

Show today's issued hourly forecasts versus available published outcomes, a defined percentage
performance measure alongside MAE in EUR/MWh, and tomorrow's issued hourly forecasts and prediction
intervals. Freeze the percentage formula, denominator, eligible population, scoring window,
zero/negative-price treatment and any success tolerance before evaluation. A benchmark-relative
percentage is labelled improvement, not correctness. Missing/pending outcomes are unscored;
partial-day scores show completeness. Scoring uses the artifact that issued the prediction,
not a newer fit. Record the price source, publication/revision times and outcome eligibility.

Distinguish nominal prediction-interval level from measured coverage and width on an explicitly
named past window. Neither means a point price has that percentage probability of being correct.
Display separate last-training, data-refresh and issuance times, delivery date/timezone,
freshness and failure state. No data or no evidence means a labelled unavailable state.

Scientific graphics separate development, unused-data and prospective results. Business
interpretation must separate forecast performance from an evaluated economic decision policy.
Cumulative net profit/value, returns or business success rates require a frozen use case,
constraints, costs, benchmark, denominator, complete time series and loss/risk disclosure;
label simulated versus realized results. Without authorized evaluation, show the specific gap
and measured forecasting implications. This is no authorization for trading, a new economic
experiment or a fabricated profitable result; programme §4.E governs such evaluation.

### 16.4 Delivery and acceptance obligations for future briefs

| Stage | Required addition to the full future checkpoint bar |
|---|---|
| Before fresh-data test | Replay the intended daily refit/update and issuance contract; freeze scoring and any evaluated economic policy before outcome access; retain the protected test boundary |
| CP-17 | Owner's final-version designation, prerequisites/disposition, policy/initialization and registry identities, daily fit and failure rules, metric formulas, resource and calendar plan |
| CP-18 | Actual scheduled training/issuance and outcome reconciliation, one product/demo identity, complete documentation/results/business sections, daily public panel and independent public acceptance |
| CP-19 | At least 90 consecutive delivery days after final freeze under §9; count real timely forecasts and failures, verify registry lineage, evaluate without tuning or excluding bad days |

Live observations and the matching demo may be published at authorized CP-18 with the label
“prospective evaluation in progress”; do not wait for CP-19 to show operation, and do not claim
completed validation before it. Public acceptance checks actual hosted output and daily records;
local fixtures do not establish daily operation. Include positive controls for altered identities,
future-label leakage, stale/failed fits, missing/zero/negative prices and partial/DST days, plus
reproducible percentage, interval and authorized business-series derivations. The full existing
independent, browser, accessibility and publication contract still applies.

No checkpoint starts here. The numeric future briefs and approved budgets remain necessary;
this amendment resolves the required product outcome, not experimental results or implementation.


## 17. CP-21 — three-block LightGBM on top of v3 (v21-r6, ratified)

**Ratified by the Owner on 2026-09-29; execution authorized under §17.11.** This is programme
work item 4.5, reframed by the Owner's choice: the three-block LightGBM is tested as an
addition to v3 (HG), not as a replacement for it. The result is published in either outcome
(§17.9). It is adopted as
`v4 · <adopted change>` under §17.6; otherwise it becomes a descriptive branch marked
"Not adopted". CP-21 is research only. It releases no product and triggers no promotion,
CP-17 freeze, prospective clock, economic run or publication by itself. CP-17–CP-19 stay
reserved (§§9–10 and §16).

### 17.1 Question, inheritance and evidence class

**Question.** HG's central forecast is a blend of two linear LEAR components. Does adding a
three-block LightGBM member, built with exactly HG's information, improve on HG jointly in
point and interval accuracy, on CP-20's development population? HG's hour-aware interval
layer is re-estimated on the new forecast's own issued errors.

**Why on top of v3.** The saved daily LightGBM B3 scores S_MAE 0.7841 / S_WIS 0.7399; HG scores
0.5658 / 0.5322. The programme's optimistic estimate for a standalone per-block LightGBM was
S_MAE 0.73–0.75 (programme §§4.5–4.8). A standalone block model is therefore not a credible
successor. The testable hypothesis is that a nonlinear, block-structured learner adds
information to HG's linear components, particularly from the weather columns. The standalone
arms remain, for attribution only.

**The decomposition.** The Owner added the pooled arm L-P to test the block hypothesis itself.
The arms form a ladder, each step adding one thing:

| Step | What it adds |
|---|---|
| B3 → L-P | Weather |
| L-P → L-R | The block split |
| L-R → HGL | The blend into v3 |

B3 is a saved CP-15 reference with fixed CP-2 hyperparameters. The B3 → L-P step therefore
also includes training-only capacity selection and the §15.3 missing-input rule, and is not an
isolated weather effect. The L-P → L-R step is controlled: L-P and L-R differ only in pooled
versus per-block fitting.

**Inherited unchanged:**

- §§2–3: information boundary and evidence class.
- §4: normalization.
- §§14.1–14.4: population, chronology, the H residual recipe, metrics, bootstrap mechanics and
  limits.
- §§15.1–15.3: weather treatment, frozen features and the missing-input rule.
- All six §8 diagnostics, reported as diagnostics; §9's restrictions; §16.

Only the arms, contrasts, adoption rule, ceilings and deliverables below are new. Historical
CP-15/16/20 results, FAILs, debits and limits are preserved. They are re-scored only as saved
references.

Every CP-21 result is `development_post_selection`. Nothing dated after 2026-04-07 is read,
scored, plotted or used for any choice, and the fresh-data test 4.7T stays reserved.

### 17.2 Arms, comparator and the single adoption candidate (Owner decision D1)

| ID | Role | Construction |
|---|---|---|
| HG | Comparator (v3), saved | CP-20's HG exactly: the saved accepted vectors. Its components A1_w (normalized LEAR) and B2_w (raw LEAR), both with weather, are reused only with verified identity. |
| L-P | Study arm, for attribution | One pooled LightGBM for all 24 hours, on the raw target, with exactly HG's information including weather (§17.3), and HG's H layer on its own issued errors. Never adoption-eligible. |
| L-R | Study arm, for attribution | Three-block LightGBM central forecast on the raw target (§17.3), with HG's H layer (§14.2) on its own issued errors |
| L-N | Study arm, for attribution | L-R with §4 target normalization; otherwise identical |
| HGL | Sole adoption candidate | Central `c = (1/3)·A1_w + (1/3)·B2_w + (1/6)·L-N + (1/6)·L-R`, that is `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·mean(L-N, L-R)`. HG's H layer is re-estimated on HGL's own issued errors. |

**The blend.** The fixed weights give each model family one equal vote: normalized LEAR, raw
LEAR and block LightGBM. They also keep HG's raw/normalized pairing inside the new member. The
weights are set before any CP-21 result and are never tuned; learned or per-block weights
belong to programme 4.8.

**What differs from HG.** HGL differs from HG only by the added member. Its A1_w and B2_w are
HG's own genuinely issued components, identical bit for bit.

**The interval layer.** HGL, L-P, L-R and L-N each use HG's layer on their own issued errors:

- the price-only A1 scale `s_t`;
- the 28-complete-released-day buffer and `w_h = n_h/(n_h+56)`;
- the seven quantiles and the §14.2 failure rule.

Residuals are never shared across forecasts.

**Retraining.** The Owner's "retrain" is met in two ways. The new member is trained at every
origin, and the interval layer is re-estimated on the composite's own errors. HG's components
are deterministic, so refitting them reproduces CP-20's forecasts. The design verifies this
through the fully refitted origins of §17.5 and reuses the verified CP-20 components elsewhere.

**Saved references, metric-only:** B0 (normalizer), B1, B2, B3, A1, H0 (v2) and HG. No
reference is refitted, except for an identity-verified regeneration of HG components on a
cache miss. Eleven policies are scored: 7 saved plus 4 new.

**The block-split claim** is reported from L-R − L-P according to its result (§17.5), not
withheld.

**Out of scope, and why:**

- **A per-block residual-correction model on HG's errors.** It would need genuinely held-forward
  HG forecasts across every training window: a nested full-history HG replay, plus weather
  retrieval for 2022-09-29..2023-03-23. In-sample residuals cannot replace those (§3).
- **A normalized pooled arm.** The split is tested on the raw target only.
- **Seed ensembles.**

These exclusions bound attribution. L-R − L-P isolates the block split on the raw target. No
contrast separates the individual weather features.

### 17.3 Block models, information set and training-only capacity selection

**Blocks.** The blocks are fixed and exhaustive, in Europe/Berlin local hours:

- night: 22–05 (8 hours);
- solar: 10–16 (7 hours);
- shoulder/peak: 06–09 and 17–21 (9 hours).

L-R and L-N fit one model per block, and a target hour belongs to exactly one block. L-P fits
one pooled model over all 24 hours, on the same rows. On a 25-hour day, both canonical
local-hour-2 observations enter the night block (and L-P's rows). On a 23-hour day the missing
hour stays absent.

**Information set: exactly HG's, for every LightGBM arm.** The features are:

- the inherited CP-15 B3/A2 LightGBM recipe: `reports/cp15/protocol.json`, 23 features, and
  for L-N its price-valued center/scale lists;
- the three frozen §15.2 weather columns for the target local hour;
- their three missing indicators, under the §15.3 training-only median-imputation rule.

Nothing else enters: no other feature, lag, cross-hour weather expansion or source, and no
feature search. LightGBM's native missing-value routing does not replace the §15.3 rule.

**Fixed settings.** Objective: quantile, α = 0.5 (p50). Seed 42, with deterministic
single-seed fits. The other inherited CP-15 parameters stay unchanged, except capacity.

**Capacity grid.** At most four configurations per model: each block model, and L-P's pooled
model. The largest is the inherited setting, 600 trees and 63 leaves; the others have lower
capacity, with fewer leaves, trees or both. The grid is frozen in the pre-run protocol before
any outer scoring and is identical for L-P, L-R and L-N.

**Selection, at every origin and for every model (each block, and L-P's pooled model):**

1. Fit each configuration on the origin's training window, minus its last 28 calendar delivery
   days.
2. Select the lowest validation MAE in EUR/MWh on those 28 days. L-N is inverted before scoring.
   An exact tie goes to the smaller configuration.
3. Refit the selected configuration on the whole window.

This mirrors LEAR's inherited inner selection and uses training data only.

**History.** `[max(2019-01-01, D−728 calendar days), D)`, subject to each origin's availability
filter, as in §14.1.

**Minimum training rows.** L-P keeps the inherited 8,760-row LightGBM minimum, which is
365 × 24. The block equivalent is 365 × block hours: 2,920 (night), 2,555 (solar) and 3,285
(shoulder/peak).

**Cadence.** Every origin gets fresh daily fits, including selection, as §16's daily retraining
would require of a product. An identical historical fit may be cached only with verified input,
protocol and origin identity. A cache miss counts as a budgeted fit.

### 17.4 Population, chronology and failure rule

**Population: CP-20's frozen population.**

- 10,747 original target keys, with fold counts 2,160 / 2,159 / 2,112 / 2,160 / 2,156, over
  448 represented delivery days.
- The CP-16/CP-20 input manifest's 638 fold/date origins, including 35 training-only admission
  dates.
- The same genuine warm-up starts: 2020-05-25 / 2021-02-23 / 2022-05-25 / 2025-03-22 / 2025-12-02.

Each new arm covers every key: 42,988 new policy-target rows, or 118,217 scored rows with the
seven saved references.

**Chronology.** Forecast origin D−1 11:00 UTC; delivery calendar Europe/Berlin; released errors
are ≤ D−2 and consumed once.

**Weather.** Weather comes only from CP-20's retained decoded grids, through the frozen
conversion, verified against CP-20's fingerprints. No weather is retrieved.

**Failure rule.** §14.2's rule applies to every component, including every LightGBM fit. No
stale, B0, HG or zero-error forecast is substituted, and losing an eligible key prevents a
complete evaluation.

**Admission slice.** §14.2's training-only admission slice checks that each new arm runs
causally before any outer scoring. It is not a selection trial.

### 17.5 Metrics, uncertainty and diagnostics

**Scores,** as in §14.3 and §15.4: emitted-p50 MAE and seven-quantile WIS; S_MAE and S_WIS as
equal-fold ratios to B0; pooled scores as secondary descriptions.

**Bootstrap,** as in §14.4 and §15.4: seed 15042, with one shared 2,000-replicate noncircular
index set of 7-calendar-day blocks per analysis pass. Blocks are drawn within each 90-date fold,
identically across policies.

**Contrasts.** The primary contrast is HGL − HG, the adoption contrast. The secondary contrasts
are descriptive:

| Contrast | What it shows |
|---|---|
| L-R − L-P | The block split: the Owner's hypothesis |
| L-P − B3 | Weather, bundled with capacity selection (§17.1) |
| L-N − L-R | Target representation |
| L-P − HG, L-R − HG, L-N − HG | Each standalone arm against v3 |

The block-split finding is stated from L-R − L-P, with §14.4's endpoint reading:

- **observed joint improvement:** the upper endpoint of ΔS_WIS < 0 and of ΔS_MAE ≤ 0;
- **observed joint worsening:** the lower endpoint of ΔS_WIS > 0 and of ΔS_MAE ≥ 0;
- **otherwise, no demonstrated joint preference,** with both metrics' directions shown.

It is a development finding, not an adoption criterion.

**What is reported for each contrast and score:**

- the paired difference, with its 95% percentile interval;
- for publication, the change as a share of the comparator's score, with the interval of that
  ratio taken from the same replicates. For each replicate b,
  `R_b = S_policy,b / S_comparator,b − 1`. The interval is the 2.5/97.5 percentiles of `R_b`,
  and the point value is the full-sample ratio minus one. Every replicate's paired differences
  and ratios are stored (PUBLISH_RULES 1.1 §3.2).

**Per-fold paired daily-loss intervals** are computed for every contrast. For HGL − HG they
feed §17.6's fourth condition; everywhere else they are descriptive. They are built exactly as
CP-20's per-fold intervals: the paired difference of each fold's mean loss, resampled with the
same 7-calendar-day block index set within that fold.

**Diagnostics, for all arms:**

- per fold, per local hour and per block (night, solar, shoulder/peak), with counts and
  represented dates. Block and hour statements follow §14.3's support rule: at least 56
  represented dates per fold.
- coverage at 50/80/95%, always shown with mean, median and 95th-percentile width, and with
  tail misses;
- central versus emitted MAE and the centering effect; bias; daily level and shape error;
- failures, and the H layer's fallback incidence;
- the stress period, fold 3: 2022-07-01..09-28, 2,112 hours over 88 days. The 17-day peak,
  2022-08-15..31 (408 hours), is reported separately and descriptively.
- all six original §8 diagnostics for every new arm, with the saved B0–B3 comparators.

**Fit cost and daily retraining.** The report covers three things:

- LightGBM fits by arm, model (block or pooled) and origin: training rows, selected capacity,
  inner and final fit wall and CPU seconds, and peak memory. The comparison of block and
  pooled costs is part of the report.
- any HG component regeneration;
- HGL's complete daily cycle, measured cold on the M3 with at most 4 workers, at 20 or more
  origins stratified across the five folds, giving the median and the maximum. The cycle
  covers the features, the A1_w/B2_w refits, the six block selections and fits, the H layer and
  issuance. Those refitted components must match CP-20's bit for bit.

**Owner decision D3:** this is a diagnostic only, not a selection criterion. v21-r5 §16 still
requires any final-product candidate to retrain daily, or to obtain an Owner-approved exception
before live admission. The report is written to `reports/block-challenger/`.

### 17.6 Pre-registered adoption rule (Owner decision D2)

Rule `cp21-adoption` was set on 2026-09-29, the date of the Owner's ratification. HGL becomes
v4 if, and only if, all four conditions hold:

1. **Joint improvement over HG.** On the paired HGL − HG differences, the upper 95% endpoint of
   ΔS_WIS is < 0 and the upper 95% endpoint of ΔS_MAE is ≤ 0.
2. **No regression on the original screen.** HGL meets all six original §8 diagnostics with the
   saved B0–B3 comparators, as HG does.
3. **A complete, valid evaluation.** Engineering PASS with a fresh binding Integration verdict,
   and every one of the 10,747 keys issued with finite, ordered quantiles.
4. **No resolved per-fold degradation.** In no fold may HGL − HG be decisively worse in MAE or
   in WIS. A fold is decisively worse when the 95% interval of its paired daily-loss difference
   (§17.5) lies entirely above zero, that is, when its lower endpoint is > 0. This applies to
   each of the five folds and to both metrics.

**Otherwise,** HGL is not adopted and CP-21 becomes a descriptive branch: "Not adopted", with
the first unmet condition and its values as the reason.

**How the rule is applied.** Mechanically. It is not re-weighted, re-thresholded or overridden
after results. A mixed result is reported as no demonstrated joint preference, never as
equivalence. L-P, L-R and L-N are never eligible for adoption, whatever they score. An
INCOMPLETE or BLOCKED return yields no adoption decision and no result to publish.

**What adoption means.** Adoption is a research status. v1 remains the released product and the
demo. No final-product designation (§16), freeze or Live follows from it. An adopted v4 becomes
the base for later extensions. At CP-21's landing, the Owner updates the standing decision
"same information, same opponent", which names HG, so that later extensions face v4 on v4's
information. Adoption is one more selection on the same five folds, so 4.7T's frozen manifest
must carry both v3 and v4.

**Naming** (plan revision 3 §16, decision 2; PUBLISH_RULES 1.1 §4). The version number is
assigned only at adoption, dated at landing.

- **Adopted:** `v4 · <adopted change>` (proposed: "v4 · three-block LightGBM added"), with
  predecessor v3. The A3 transition title is "From v3 to v4: adding a three-block LightGBM".
- **Not adopted:** the branch "Three-block LightGBM on v3", attached after v3.

### 17.7 Causal and integrity controls

Every negative assertion has a positive control that can fail, and that survives the model's
own transforms. The following are required for all new arms.

- **Inherited controls: §14.8 item 3 and §15.6 item 4.**
  - A delivery-day price mutation changes forecasts by exactly 0.0.
  - An available D−1 mutation moves a controlled forecast.
  - Post-gate and target-actual inputs are refused.
  - D−1 errors are refused; D−2 errors are accepted once released.
  - Each error is consumed once, and no partial day enters the buffer.
  - 23/24/25-hour days keep their identity.
  - Transforms are fitted on training data only, and warm-up is genuine.
  - State persists and replays after a restart; a stale or wrong cache is refused.
  - Quantiles are finite and ordered.
- **Transform-aware positive controls for LightGBM.** Trees are invariant to monotone feature
  rescaling, and normalization cancels a uniform price scaling. Weather influence must
  therefore be shown with a non-monotone perturbation, for example a cross-date permutation of
  weather vectors. The D−1 price control on L-N must use a non-uniform mutation.
- **Training-only selection,** for every LightGBM model, block or pooled. Altering outcomes
  after an origin leaves that origin's selected capacity, fits and forecasts exactly unchanged;
  altering inner-validation rows can change them.
- **Pooled–block parity.** L-P and L-R differ only in pooled versus per-block fitting: the same
  rows, target, features, grid, selection rule and H recipe.
- **Block membership and DST.** Every canonical target hour maps to exactly one block; repeated
  and missing local hours are handled as in §17.3.
- **Boundary guard.** Materializing any input or outcome dated after 2026-04-07 fails, with a
  positive control.
- **Blend and layer parity.**
  - HGL's A1_w and B2_w equal HG's bit for bit.
  - `c_HGL − (2/3)·c_HG = (1/3)·mean(L-N, L-R)`, within floating-point tolerance.
  - HGL, L-P, L-R, L-N and HG call the same H-layer code path.
- **HG identity.**
  - Cached components match their CP-20 fingerprints.
  - Independent representative HG reproduction matches the accepted CP-20 vectors.
- **Byte-exact storage** of every hash-bound file.

### 17.8 Ceilings and calendar (Owner decision D4)

**Nature of the caps.** These are Owner-approved maxima, not estimates or targets. They were
approved as recommended on 2026-09-29, then recomputed for the added arm L-P.

- **What counts:** warm-up, admission, inner selection, controls, failures, repairs and
  independent review.
- **At a cap:** stop before the first cap is exhausted and retain the partial evidence. No
  outcome-driven retry, new arm, grid change or automatic increase follows.
- **Debits:** previous debits stay historical. Nothing transfers from CP-16 or CP-20.

| Dimension | Maximum |
|---|---|
| Policies | 4 new (L-P, L-R, L-N, HGL) and 7 saved references: 11 scored. 1 adoption candidate. 0 other arms: no normalized pooled arm, residual-correction model or blend-weight trial. |
| Blend and interval layer | 1 fixed blend (§17.2) and 1 inherited H recipe. 0 alternative weights, residual configurations or outer-score selections. |
| Capacity grid and seeds | At most 4 configurations per model, the same for L-P, L-R and L-N. Fitting seed 42; bootstrap seed 15042. 0 seed ensembles or seed searches. |
| LightGBM fits | At most 24,000 main fit attempts. Nominal all-fresh: 638 origins × (2 block arms × 3 blocks + 1 pooled model) × 5 fits = 22,330. At most 35,000 in total, including controls, reproduction, failures and repairs. |
| HG components | Reuse the verified CP-20 components. With the fully refitted origins of §17.5 or a cache miss: at most 1,600 component-day attempts (nominal 1,276) and 192,000 primitive Lasso attempts. |
| Replay | At most 10,500 new policy-days: about 4 full-equivalent passes of 4 × 638 = 2,552, counted under §14.5's rule. |
| References and uncertainty | At most 3 metric-only reference passes. At most 3 bootstrap analysis passes, including independent review, with 2,000 replicates each. |
| Compute | At most 60 aggregate machine-hours, summed across concurrent jobs and including tests, failures and review. At most 4 concurrent worker threads in total (LightGBM threads × processes ≤ 4); BLAS 1; 0 GPU or cloud. |
| Memory and disk | 10 GiB aggregate RSS. 20 GiB added peak disk, including worktrees, caches, the local MLflow store and outputs. |
| Data, network and cost | 0 bytes of new data or model download. 0 weather retrieval. 0 remote writes (MLflow, Hub, Git remote). $0. |
| Effort | Approximate timebox of 32 active hours. Hard ceiling of 40 active hours, including verification and the return. |

**Basis for the recomputation.** CP-15's pooled daily B3 fits took about 3 seconds each, and a
block model trains on about a third of those rows. Worst case, with single-thread parallel
workers, the 22,330 main fits need about 28 aggregate machine-hours. Controls, reproduction,
review, scoring and tests add about 12. The 60-hour cap leaves a 1.5× margin.

**Unattended execution.** No long unattended run is required or authorized.

**Before dependent work,** the Lead completes §14.6 E1–E4 for CP-21:

- actual origin and fit enumeration;
- the grid, fixtures and cache identities;
- feasibility against every cap and the independent-review allowance.

An insufficient allowance returns a concrete blocker, not a smaller experiment.

### 17.9 Publication packet and MLflow (Owner decision D5)

From CP-21 on, the checkpoint supplies its publication packet (PUBLISH_RULES 1.1 §11;
Publication Standard v1 §12). The landing templates do not carry it yet; that incorporation is
decision D6 of 2026-09-28, a separate governance task. Until then, this section and the brief
carry the step explicitly.

- **Pinned rules:** PUBLISH_RULES 1.1, SHA-256
  `91eea445434718a163f03bcfd82e1db275a9d98311e76eb6cd1365f3707584f3`. It incorporates
  Publication Standard v1 (`01d721c2ba6316ca9a2f707e79da229bef732e91bad22f6ce457fb01e69478cc`) and
  presentation plan revision 3 (`281193740a256a99a1676d53ef61c9babb5f744a7d0fb038927e305d1149812c`).
- **The packet:** `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-21/publication-packet.md`, filling every section of
  `docs/track-b/publication-packet-template.md`:
  - identity;
  - draft registry entries: HGL as a `v4 · …` generation or as the branch, per §17.6; L-P, L-R
    and L-N as study arms; comparator HG; population `common-10747h`;
  - the claim map `docs/track-b/research-content/cp21-claims.md`, with its withheld claims.
    It includes the block-split finding stated from L-R − L-P (§17.5) and the
    B3 → L-P → L-R → HGL ladder, with the bundling in the B3 → L-P step disclosed;
  - the derived headline quantities: the verdict, the rule and its date, the distance from HG,
    N, §17.5's ratio intervals with seed, replicates and block length, and per-fold MAE with
    fold 3 as the stress period;
  - draft slot texts for the outcome the rule yields: the v4 chapter plus the A3 transition, or
    the branch card;
  - §5b and §5d marked not applicable, with the reason: the released product and the
    final-product designation do not change;
  - §8's intended identities for GitHub/README, Pages, MLflow, the Space card and the direct
    demo.
- **The MLflow step:**
  - The experiment is `delu-generations`.
  - Runs are tracked locally only, in `.local/mlruns/cp21`: one parent, `cp21`, and one child
    per new policy (`cp21/HGL`, `cp21/L-P`, `cp21/L-R`, `cp21/L-N`). Their names and tags follow
    the draft entries.
  - A draft export, `reports/block-challenger/mlflow-export-draft/cp21.json`, is built through
    `scripts/mlflow_export.py`'s code path from committed CP-21 evidence and the packet's draft
    entries.
    - **Why a draft.** It stays outside the published set because registry statuses are dated
      at landing, and registering a generation or branch requires its chapter or card.
    - **Pending fields.** Identities that exist only at landing are explicit pending fields:
      the adoption date and source, the evidence-tag commit and the landing record.
  - The published export set is unchanged: `reports/presentation/mlflow-export/`, including its
    `manifest.json`. `mlflow_export.py --check` still passes on it.
  - The publication block registers the entries and regenerates the final export. That export
    must equal the draft apart from the pending fields, and it must change no previously
    published record.
  - There is no public write, no upload and no network call to DagsHub.
- **Public surfaces are unchanged in CP-21.** CP-21 does not regenerate or modify any of the
  following; they belong to the separate publication block after landing:
  - the page;
  - the README's generated blocks;
  - the Space cards and bundles;
  - the public registry's rendered entries;
  - the existing exports.

  CI and `make verify` stay green at the final candidate.
- **Acceptance:** the Integration Critic reviews the packet and the export as artifacts.
  - Every number re-derives from committed rows.
  - Names and statuses follow the draft entries and §17.6's mechanical verdict.
  - The diff touches nothing already published.

Publication itself follows the Owner's LAND in either outcome, as a separate block under
PUBLISH_RULES 1.1: the registry, the chapter or branch card, the page, the README, the MLflow
upload, the Space and the postdeploy checks. See
[the publication plan](docs/track-b/cp-21-publication-plan-2026-09-29.md).

**Owner decision D6:** if v4 is adopted, its chart encoding is amber `#B45309`, a filled
diamond marker and the direct label "v4" (PRES-1 W16(b)).

### 17.10 Complete CP-21 acceptance checklist

All thirteen items are mandatory. Engineering PASS does not require adoption: a complete,
valid "Not adopted" result can pass.

1. Verify the repository and input state, and preserve prior evidence and other sessions'
   work.
   - The ratified anchor and the amendment record are on `main` at the ratification commit;
     verify their SHA-256 against the brief.
   - On `gauntlet/cp-21`, package the issued brief byte for byte as
     `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-21/issued-brief.md`, from its canonical copy
     `.local/artifacts/cp-21/issued-brief.md`, and record its SHA-256.
   - Before any outer scoring, commit the frozen pre-run protocol:
     - the arms, blend weights, block map, feature list and missing rule;
     - the capacity grid, inner split and tie rule;
     - fixtures, seeds, the key/origin manifest and cache identities;
     - budget accounting and the §17.6 rule text.
2. Verify the CP-20 population and manifest identities, and the frozen weather features from
   the retained grids. Reuse HG components only with verified identity, and obtain an
   independent representative HG reproduction that matches the accepted CP-20 vectors. No
   retrieval, and no data after 2026-04-07.
3. Implement exactly L-P, L-R, L-N and HGL, with training-only capacity selection for every
   LightGBM model. Prove three things:
   - HGL differs from HG only by the added member and uses HG's H recipe on its own errors;
   - L-R and L-N differ only in target representation;
   - L-P and L-R differ only in pooled versus per-block fitting.
4. Prove every §17.7 control, pairing each negative assertion with a positive control that
   survives the model's transforms. Rerun the applicable inherited regression and namespace
   guards without a live mutation.
5. Produce all 10,747 keys for each new arm, with finite, ordered quantiles and the emitted p50
   kept separate from the central forecast. Account for failures, exclusions and fallback
   incidence without changing denominators.
6. Score all eleven policies. Independently verify:
   - the emitted-vector scores and the equal-fold normalization;
   - every per-fold, hour, block, stress and peak diagnostic, with its denominators and support
     labels;
   - coverage together with width;
   - all six §8 diagnostics for each new arm.
7. Apply §17.6's four conditions mechanically.
   - Report the primary and secondary contrasts with paired intervals, per-fold intervals, and
     the ratio intervals from the checkpoint's own stored draws.
   - State the block-split finding from L-R − L-P, with §17.5's reading.
   - State the verdict, v4 or not adopted, with the first unmet condition; state mixed and
     negative findings.
   - Keep the Engineering status, the research finding and the product status (v1 released)
     distinct. No promotion, freeze or economic claim.
8. Deliver §17.5's fit-cost and daily-retrain diagnostic in `reports/block-challenger/`.
9. Enforce and report every §17.8 cap from the first job, including controls, failures and
   independent review. At an exhausted cap, retain the
   partial evidence and return the applicable non-PASS status.
10. Supply the durable evidence and executable reproduction commands: the protocol, lineage,
    predictions, metrics, diagnostics, uncertainty with stored replicates, criteria, failures,
    resources and the fit-cost report. Store hash-bound files byte for byte, and disclose
    defects, repairs and invalidated outputs.
11. Deliver §17.9's publication packet and draft MLflow export, with public surfaces and the
    published export set unchanged, CI green and no public write.
12. Obtain one fresh, independent Integration-Critic PASS on a clean detached checkout of the
    exact final candidate. The review covers this entire checklist and:
    - independently recomputes the saved-vector metrics, the paired, per-fold and ratio
      intervals and the §17.6 verdict;
    - representatively reproduces HG, a block and a pooled LightGBM selection and fit, and the
      causal and state controls;
    - re-derives the packet and the export.
13. Return the canonical packet (templates §3), together with the publication packet:
    - both terminal SHAs and a verdict-only delta;
    - reachable evidence;
    - all resource totals and elapsed hours;
    - branch and worktree accounting.

    Stop at CP-21's local result.

### 17.11 Paths and entry authority

**Write paths:**

- `src/cp21/`, `tests/cp21/`, `scripts/cp21_blocks.py`;
- `reports/block-challenger/`, `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-21/`;
- `docs/track-b/research-content/cp21-claims.md`;
- `scripts/mlflow_export.py` and its tests, only as needed for the draft export, without
  changing the published export set or any published record;
- `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, only if a necessary pinned dependency is missing. None is
  expected: LightGBM is already pinned.

**Ignored material:** `.local/{worktrees,artifacts,tmp}/cp-21/` and `.local/mlruns/cp21`.

**Read-only:** CP-15/16/20 code and reports; `.local/artifacts/cp-20/` (the weather grids and
the HG component cache); `reports/weather-admission/`.

**Preserve:** v1; the CP-15/16/20 evidence; the public surfaces; Q&A; `progress.md`; every
locked document.

**Roles.** The accountable executor is the CP-21 Engineering Lead. The reviewer is its fresh,
independent Integration Critic under `engineering-role.md`.

**Ratification and CP-21 execution authority: GRANTED by the Owner, 2026-09-29.** The grant
covers:

- CP-21 execution under this section and the issued brief;
- local `gauntlet/cp-21` candidate and evidence commits;
- exact immutable packaging of the issued brief (item 1). The ratified anchor and the
  v21-r5 → v21-r6 amendment record are already on `main`.

**Not authorized:** mainline operations, pushes, tags, publication, remote writes (MLflow,
Hub), data retrieval, governance edits and later checkpoints. The Lead owns E1–E4 and the
pre-run feasibility check, and escalates only a concrete blocker beyond this scope.


## 18. Distribution challenger — DDNN only, written in NumPy (v21-r7)

**Owner amendment, 2026-09-30.** This section governs programme work item 4.6 and every later
use of DDNN in this programme. It is not a checkpoint bar and grants no execution authority. A
future 4.6 brief supplies the bar, budgets and protocol, under the programme handoff, §16 and
the standing decisions in force when it is written.

### 18.1 TabPFN is withdrawn

TabPFN leaves the programme, in every version. It is not a research candidate, a comparator, a
recombination member or a final-product candidate. No TabPFN licence entry, resource entry,
comparison, context construction or weight download will run.

- Programme item 4.6 becomes a single-candidate DDNN route: 4.6L, then 4.6R, then 4.6C.
- The planned TabPFN–DDNN comparison is **withdrawn by Owner decision**, before any run. It is
  not reported as failed, blocked or "not completed", and no TabPFN-versus-DDNN claim is made.
- §16.2's general rule stands: refreshing inputs, residual state or context is not weight
  training. Its TabPFN example no longer names a candidate.
- Bringing TabPFN back needs a new Owner amendment.

**Context, recorded with the decision.** The Owner decided this while weighing an option to
retrain the final product in the browser, so that anyone who wants to check it can. TabPFN is a
pretrained transformer. Its daily update would be context replacement, which §16.2 does not
count as training. It has no runtime under Pyodide, where the current demo executes, and its
licence entry (handoff 4.6L) was unresolved.

### 18.2 DDNN is written from the start in NumPy only

1. **One implementation.** DDNN's model code is written from scratch in this repository and
   depends on NumPy and the Python standard library alone. That covers the network, the
   Johnson SU distributional head and its likelihood, the gradients, the optimizer,
   regularization, the training loop, early stopping, seeding, ensembling and the emission of
   quantiles and p50. No deep-learning framework (PyTorch, TensorFlow or Keras, JAX or the
   like), no other numerical library, no third-party DDNN code and no pretrained weights enter
   it.
2. **Every DDNN number comes from it.** The same code produces every DDNN research result, every
   daily fit and every forecast that any surface shows. No second implementation is written for
   another runtime, and no other implementation's output stands in for its output.
3. **Inputs.** The model code takes its design matrix from the common admitted feature pipeline,
   under the same information, history and causal rules as every other candidate. That pipeline
   is outside this rule.
4. **Purpose and limit.** One code path runs from research to any later server or browser run,
   so the model a visitor might retrain is the model that was evaluated. This section does not
   decide in-browser retraining: whether a daily fit runs in the browser, and what equality with
   the issued artifact it claims, is decided under §16 in the final-product briefs. Training is
   sensitive to floating-point order, so equality between runtimes is measured, never assumed. A
   claim states its measured tolerance, and bitwise identity is claimed only where it was
   measured.

### 18.3 PyTorch is a host-side correctness reference only

PyTorch may be used only on the development machine, inside tests, as an independent reference
that checks the NumPy implementation:

- the forward pass, the Johnson SU log-likelihood and its gradients, and short optimizer
  trajectories on fixed inputs and seeds, at tolerances the 4.6 brief fixes before any
  comparison run;
- alongside finite-difference gradient checks of the NumPy code itself.

PyTorch never trains a model whose output is scored, published or issued, and it never emits a
forecast, quantile, metric or artifact that enters evidence. It is not a runtime dependency of
research, server or browser code; it enters the environment only as a test dependency. The 4.6
brief fixes how those tests are installed and run, so that they cannot be skipped silently. A
failed check blocks DDNN's results until the NumPy code is fixed. A tolerance changes only
through a recorded protocol change, never silently after a failure.

### 18.4 Consequences for the 4.6 route

- **4.6L** becomes a provenance and licence record. The DDNN code is original, under the
  repository's MIT licence, with its method sources cited and no third-party code or weights.
  The record states the licence of each test-only dependency, and its use table still gives
  every use of DDNN's outputs a disposition. Those outputs remain derived from the CC BY 4.0
  data (`DATA-LICENSE.md`).
- **4.6R** gains one entry condition: the §18.3 checks pass before DDNN's resource measurements
  count.
- **4.6C** becomes one predefined comparison between DDNN and the references its brief fixes,
  under the standing information and comparator decisions then in force. If DDNN fails entry,
  no comparison runs, and the failure is reported to 4.7.
- **§16 applies unchanged** if DDNN is ever designated final: daily retraining, not input or
  state refresh alone, or an explicit Owner-approved exception before live admission.
- **Nothing is opened.** DDNN work needs its own brief, D4 allowances and budgets.

### 18.5 What stays as it was

- §§1–17, and every closed checkpoint's evidence, including CP-21's binding of the v21-r6
  bytes.
- PUBLISH_RULES 1.1, unedited. Its sentence "No such exception is granted here to TabPFN,
  immutable v1 or any other model" remains accurate.
- Historical records that name TabPFN: reviews, briefs, claim ledgers, research content and the
  presentation plan. They describe what was planned when they were written.
- The public report. Its planned item "4.6 · DDNN / TabPFN" is corrected by the next authorized
  publication block, not by this amendment.


## 19. Final-product Space — what it computes and claims (v21-r8)

**Owner amendment, 2026-09-30.** This section governs what the final product's Hugging Face
Space computes, what it may claim, and the in-browser retraining requirement. It binds the CP-17
and CP-18 briefs at the final-product rollout of §16. It is not a checkpoint bar and executes
nothing now. Presentation and acceptance are PUBLISH_RULES 1.2 §7.3 (A9). The implementation
plan is `docs/track-b/final-product-space-plan-2026-09-30.md`.

### 19.1 Scope

The Space is the product's interactive tool, under §16.1's single identity for final version,
product, primary demo and daily policy. It serves only the designated final product; v1's frozen
demo remains a labelled history route. The Space computes only from the records the daily
pipeline publishes to it (§19.4). At runtime it fetches nothing from data sources, registries or
tracking services.

### 19.2 One code path

The code that performs the daily fit, issuance and scoring is the code the Space runs in the
browser for §19.3 and §19.5. No second implementation stands in for the product. A component
that cannot run in the browser runtime is reported at CP-17 under §19.3's exception route; it is
never replaced silently.

### 19.3 "Train it yourself" is required

The Owner requires an in-browser retraining action for the final product.

1. **What it does.** In the visitor's browser, it retrains the daily fit of one issued delivery
   day from that fit's shipped training window, with the same code, seed and selection rules.
   It then predicts that day's quantiles.
2. **What it reports.**
   - whether every data-driven selection matched the issued artifact;
   - the largest absolute difference per emitted quantile, in EUR/MWh;
   - one status that states only what was measured: identical bit for bit, within the frozen
     tolerance τ_eq, or different.
3. **What it never does.** It never replaces, rescores or relabels an issued forecast.
4. **The probe.** Before the CP-17 freeze, a feasibility probe on development data measures, for
   the designated policy:
   - browser time and memory;
   - payload sizes;
   - the deviation from the native fit;
   - selection agreement.

   CP-17 freezes τ_eq and the reference runtime from that measurement.
5. **If the policy cannot meet this requirement** within the measured limits, CP-17 returns a
   blocker. Only an explicit Owner exception, with its public wording, lets the product ship
   without the action. The requirement is never dropped silently, and never met by retraining a
   different implementation.

### 19.4 Daily delivery

Each delivery day, the authorized pipeline publishes a dated bundle to the Space: the issued
forecasts, the issuing artifact and its lineage, the reconciled outcomes and the evaluation
records. The bundle's manifest lists every served file with its SHA-256. The Space shows the
served identity and its freshness. A forecast recomputed by a newer fit is never shown or scored
as issued. Delivery needs the separate operational and publication authority of §16.2 and
programme 4.9; this section grants none.

### 19.5 Definitions frozen at CP-17, before the fresh-data test

CP-17's freeze fixes the following before 4.7T:

- **The percentage measure beside MAE:** its formula; the tolerance, which the Owner sets; the
  denominator; eligible and partial-day hours; and zero, negative and missing prices.
  - The proposed form is the share of scored hours within ±τ EUR/MWh.
  - A figure relative to a benchmark is improvement, not correctness.
- **Coverage and width** per nominal band, and the rolling window over scored delivery days.
- **The reliability diagram:** for each emitted quantile level, the observed share of outcomes
  at or below it, with counts.
- **The quantile-band PIT:** the share of outcomes between adjacent emitted quantiles, against
  each band's nominal share.
- **The recomputation check.** The Space recomputes its evaluation metrics from the shipped
  issued forecasts and outcomes, and compares them with the committed records.
  - Counts match exactly; real values match within a frozen tolerance.
  - A mismatch is shown, and blocks that day's publication as a product failure.

Nothing in this list is chosen after seeing evaluation outcomes.

### 19.6 Evaluation windows

Three windows stay separate and are never pooled:

- development, static, from evidence;
- the one-shot fresh-data test (4.7T);
- the prospective record from the run start, "in progress" until CP-19.

v1's holdout stays v1 history.

### 19.7 Attribution and importance

Methods are fixed by component class:

- **a blend:** each component's weight times its forecast, an exact decomposition;
- **linear components:** coefficient times the centered, standardized input;
- **tree components:** per-prediction contributions (TreeSHAP), and gain read from the fitted
  model;
- **a neural component:** a method frozen at CP-17.

All are presented as attribution within one fitted artifact, never as causality or incremental
value.

### 19.8 Data displays

Data and feature views compute from the shipped series. Before the final test, no research
display uses data after 2026-04-07 (standing decision of 2026-09-24). From CP-18, the views run
through the latest published day, labelled with its last date.

### 19.9 What this section does not do

It designates no model, runs no fit, schedules nothing, and grants no publication, credential or
`AGENTS.md` authority. Unattended daily publication needs the Owner's explicit authority before
CP-18's launch. CP-17 and CP-18 still need their complete bars and briefs.


## 20. CP-22 — v4 revised: one pooled member and a dynamic interval layer (v21-r9)

### 20.1 The question and the Owner's decisions

**The request.** On 2026-10-01 the Owner asked to re-examine v4 before DDNN. The Owner proposed
to decompose v4 − v3 into its factors, examine each one, and reassemble the best combination.

**The Owner's decisions, the same day:**

- **Replacement.** The new version replaces v4. It takes v4's place and keeps its number
  (PUBLISH_RULES 1.3, A10).
- **The split.** The block split is removed in every outcome; it has no mechanism behind it.
- **D1–D8** are approved as recommended (§20.12).
- **Both fail.** If both eligible policies fail §20.6, CP-22 stops at its return and the Owner
  decides.
- **Dynamics.** The 28-day buffer is too rigid for a crisis onset, so the interval layer must
  learn more dynamically (§20.3).

**What CP-22 decides.** It does not reopen the removal of the split. It decides two things:

1. which pooled member replaces v4's three-block member: R first, then M;
2. whether a dynamic interval layer (DL) replaces HG's equal-weight 28-day buffer on the winner.

It also measures what each change costs or gains.

**Committed CP-21 evidence that motivates the design** (`evidence/cp-21`; all
`development_post_selection`):

- **The gain comes from the member, not the split.**
  - Alone, the tree arms score 0.5769–0.5835 S_MAE, against v3's 0.5658.
  - Blended, v4 scores 0.5357.
  - The block split, L-R − L-P, shows no demonstrated joint preference.
  - The pooled features include `local_hour`.
- **The raw half drives the peak degradation.** Over the 2022-08-15..31 peak:

  | Policy | MAE (EUR/MWh) |
  |---|---|
  | v3 | 47.5 |
  | L-N, normalized | 52.2 |
  | v4 | 50.1 |
  | L-P, raw | 66.3 |
  | L-R, raw | 70.1 |

  L-P and L-R fail §8 criterion 4, and L-R also fails criterion 5.
- **The normalized pooled member was never tested.** It was excluded by §17.2. L-N is the best
  tree arm overall.
- **The daily capacity selection is mostly noise.**
  - The smallest configuration G1 was chosen on 24–44% of origins, depending on the model, and
    the largest, G4, on 20–33%.
  - On the inner 28-day validation, the winner beat the runner-up by a median of 1.5% relative
    MAE (`reports/block-challenger/fits.parquet`).
- **The intervals under-cover.** 95% coverage in folds 1–4 is 0.932–0.936 for v3 and 0.933–0.940
  for v4, against the nominal 0.95.

**Disclosed:** the Owner and the agents know CP-15's, CP-20's and CP-21's results on these folds.
CP-22 is one more decision on the same five folds. Its results stay
`development_post_selection`, and 4.7T carries the protection.

**The ladder,** one change per step:

| Step | Change |
|---|---|
| v4 → M | The split removed: block models replaced by pooled models, with the same raw/normalized mix and daily selection |
| M → A-PN-sel | The raw half dropped |
| A-PN-sel → R | Averaging over capacities instead of daily selection |
| W → W+ACI → W+DL → W+DLF | Adaptive coverage, then recency weights, then a fast component added on top, on the winner W |

### 20.2 Arms, comparator and eligible policies (D1)

**The new model, PN.** One pooled LightGBM for all 24 hours, on §4's normalized target.

- **Information:** exactly HG's and v4's (§17.3), including `local_hour`, the three frozen GFS
  columns and their missing indicators under §15.3's training-only imputation.
- **Fixed settings, grid, history and minimum rows:** §17.3's, as for L-P: G1–G4; history
  `[max(2019-01-01, D−728), D)`; at least 8,760 rows; fresh fits at every origin.

**Its two forms:**

- **PN-avg** is the equal mean of G1–G4's four full-window forecasts. Each is inverted to
  EUR/MWh with the origin's common center and scale. Averaging before or after the inversion is
  identical, because the inversion is affine; a fixture proves it.
- **PN-sel** applies §17.3's selection rule:
  - inner fits on the window minus its last 28 calendar delivery days;
  - the lowest validation MAE in EUR/MWh after inversion, with an exact tie going to the smaller
    configuration;
  - a refit on the whole window.

  Its final fit is the selected configuration's full-window fit, bit for bit.

| ID | Role | Central forecast |
|---|---|---|
| v4 | Comparator: CP-21's saved HGL vectors | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·mean(L-N, L-R)` |
| v3 | Reference: CP-20's saved HG vectors | `c_HG` |
| R | Eligible, tried first | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·PN-avg` |
| M | Eligible, tried second | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·mean(PN-sel, L-P)` |
| A-PN-sel | Attribution | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·PN-sel` |
| A-LP | Attribution: "v3 + pooled raw", never tested | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·L-P` |
| A-LN | Attribution, descriptive | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·L-N` |
| W+DL | Eligible for the layer decision only (§20.6) | W's central, with DL (§20.3) |
| W+ACI | Attribution: adaptive coverage on the unweighted 28-day buffer | W's central |
| W+DLF | Eligible only as an add-on to W+DL (§20.6): DL plus a fast component for sharp changes (Owner, 2026-10-01) | W's central |
| v4+DL, v3+DL | Attribution, descriptive | v4's or v3's central, with DL |

**Reused vectors.** L-P, L-N, HGL (v4) and HG are reused from `evidence/cp-21` and CP-20, each
only with verified identity.

**Interval layers.** Every composite except the DL variants uses HG's H layer on its own issued
errors (§17.2).

**Fixed:**

- the 1/3 member weight;
- HG's components, bit for bit (§17.2).

**Excluded:**

- learned or per-block weights, which stay in programme 4.8 (D6);
- new features, blocks or block boundaries;
- seed ensembles;
- a residual-correction model;
- any LEAR change (D8).

### 20.3 The dynamic interval layer (D7; the Owner's decision on dynamics)

**Why.** The equal-weight 28-day buffer reacts slowly at a crisis onset, and v3 and v4
under-cover in four of five folds. The 168-hour scale `s_t` already adapts within a week; the
buffer's shape, its bias correction and its coverage do not.

**What DL keeps from HG's H layer (§14.2):**

- the residuals `r_t = (y_t − c_t)/s_t`, with the same `s_t`;
- the 28-complete-released-day buffer span, and therefore the same warm-up;
- the hour shrinkage form `w_h = n_h/(n_h + 56)`, with `w_h = 0` below 14 days;
- the seven quantiles;
- the release, consume-once and failure rules.

**What DL changes.** Two things, both fixed before any scoring and never tuned on outcomes:

1. **Recency weights inside the buffer.**
   - Each complete released day in the buffer has weight `2^(−a/7)`, where `a` is its age in
     days and the newest day has age 0. This is a half-life of 7 days, matching `s_t`'s 168
     hours.
   - Weighted empirical quantiles replace the equal-weight `Q_P` and `Q_h`.
   - `n_h` becomes hour h's effective count, `(Σw)²/Σw²`.
   - The p50 bias correction becomes the weighted median.
2. **Adaptive coverage (ACI; Gibbs–Candès convention).** α is a miscoverage.
   - For each central interval with nominal α ∈ {0.05, 0.20, 0.50}, keep a working level `α_t`.
     It starts at α at each fold's genuine warm-up start, and the warm-up updates it.
   - After each released complete day, `α_{t+1} = α_t + γ·(α − m_t)`, where `m_t` is that day's
     fraction of canonical hours outside the interval emitted at `α_t`.
   - **Fixed parameters:**
     - `γ = 0.10` per day;
     - `α_t` clipped to `[α/5, min(2α, 0.9)]`;
     - the interval at `α_t` uses the residual levels `α_t/2` and `1 − α_t/2`.
   - A day with more misses than nominal lowers `α_t`, widening the interval. A day with fewer
     raises it.
   - If adjusted quantiles cross, a fixed monotone rearrangement (sorting) restores order.

**DL is a separate decision,** applied to the winner after the replacement rule (§20.6). W+ACI
isolates the recency weights.

**W+DLF adds a fast component for sharp changes (Owner, 2026-10-01).** It keeps DL's 7-day
memory and adds a second, fast kernel on top, so that a sudden jump or a large error weighs more
at once.

- **The weights:** `(2/3)·k7(a)/Σk7 + (1/3)·k1(a)/Σk1`, where `k7(a) = 2^(−a/7)` and
  `k1(a) = 2^(−a)`. The fast kernel has a one-day half-life and carries one third of the weight.
- **The effect:** the newest released day carries about 23% of the buffer's weight instead of
  about 10%, and the buffer keeps about 10 effective days.
- **Everything else is identical,** including ACI.
- **It never replaces the 7-day memory.** It can only be added to it (§20.6).

### 20.4 Population, chronology and failure rule

§17.4 applies unchanged:

- 10,747 keys, 638 origins and the same genuine warm-up starts;
- forecast origin D−1 11:00 UTC; released errors ≤ D−2, consumed once;
- weather only from CP-20's retained grids;
- §14.2's failure rule;
- the training-only admission slice.

**Reused vectors.** Saved CP-21 and CP-20 vectors are reused only when they match their
committed blobs.

**Warm-up errors.** The warm-up errors that the H and DL buffers need for v4, L-P and L-N come
from CP-21's retained state, or are regenerated within §20.8's caps. A regenerated vector must
equal CP-21's issued vector bit for bit.

### 20.5 Metrics, uncertainty and diagnostics

§17.5 applies:

- the scores;
- the bootstrap: seed 15042, one shared 2,000-replicate index set of 7-calendar-day blocks within
  each fold;
- ratio intervals from the same replicates, with every replicate stored;
- per-fold paired daily-loss intervals;
- the diagnostics for every arm, including all six §8 diagnostics, coverage with width, and the
  stress period and peak.

**Contrasts:**

| Contrast | Role |
|---|---|
| R − v4, M − v4 | The replacement decision (§20.6) |
| (W+DL) − W | The layer decision (§20.6) |
| R − M | The full refinement against the minimal one |
| A-PN-sel − M | Dropping the raw half |
| R − A-PN-sel | Averaging against daily selection |
| A-PN-sel − A-LP | Normalized against raw, pooled |
| A-LN − v4 | Descriptive: the blocks under normalization |
| (W+ACI) − W, (W+DL) − (W+ACI) | DL's two parts |
| (W+DLF) − (W+DL) | The fast component: overall, by fold and on shock days (below) |
| (v4+DL) − v4, (v3+DL) − v3 | DL on the earlier generations, descriptive |
| Each policy − v3 | Reference |

Each secondary contrast gets §17.5's endpoint reading: observed joint improvement, observed joint
worsening, or no demonstrated joint preference.

**The Owner's investigation,** reported descriptively and choosing nothing:

- the decomposition of v4 − v3 by factor, with the member-weight curve labelled "oracle, not
  selectable";
- PN's capacity-selection stability (flip rate and winner margin), next to CP-21's L-P, L-R and
  L-N;
- extrapolation: forecasts against each origin's training-window maximum on extreme days;
- coverage by hour, block and regime, with each fold's `α_t` path and the days DL took to react
  after the peak began;
- **sharp changes.** A fixed shock-day set:
  - in each fold, the 5% of delivery days with the largest absolute change in daily mean price
    from the previous day;
  - the peak's first ten days.

  On those days, and on the three days after each, report MAE, WIS and coverage for W, W+DL and
  W+DLF;
- **LEAR's penalty-selection stability (D8).** It is measured from logged selections where they
  exist, and otherwise reported as unavailable. No LEAR refit is made for this purpose.
- **Fit cost and daily cycle:**
  - PN's inner and final fits against L-P's;
  - the replacement's complete daily cycle, cold on the M3 with at most 4 workers, at 20 or more
    origins stratified across folds.

  This is a diagnostic, not a criterion (§17.5's D3 applies). The report is written to
  `reports/v4-revision/`.

### 20.6 Pre-registered rules (D2, D7), set 2026-10-01

**Rule `cp22-replacement`.** R replaces v4's three-block construction if all four of these hold,
against v4 on identical rows:

1. **Non-inferior on both scores.** Neither ΔS_MAE nor ΔS_WIS (R − v4) has a 95% interval lying
   entirely above zero.
2. **No regression.** R meets all six original §8 diagnostics.
3. **A complete, valid evaluation.** Engineering PASS with a binding Integration verdict, and all
   10,747 keys issued.
4. **No resolved per-fold degradation.** No fold has a 95% paired daily-loss interval (R − v4)
   lying entirely above zero, in MAE or in WIS.

**Otherwise, M replaces v4** if M meets the same four conditions. **Otherwise, there is no
replacement.** CP-22 stops at its return and the Owner decides (Owner decision, 2026-10-01); the
three-block v4 stays the current revision until then. The winner, R or M, is W.

**Rule `cp22-dynamic-layer`.** It applies only if W exists. W+DL becomes the replacement if all
five of these hold, against W on identical rows:

1. the upper 95% endpoint of ΔS_WIS is below zero;
2. ΔS_MAE has no 95% interval lying entirely above zero;
3. W+DL meets all six §8 diagnostics;
4. W+DL's pooled 95% coverage is closer to 0.95 than W's;
5. no fold has a 95% paired daily-loss interval (W+DL − W) lying entirely above zero, in MAE or
   in WIS.

Otherwise, the replacement is W with HG's H layer.

**Rule `cp22-fast-component`.** It applies only if W+DL was adopted. W+DLF replaces W+DL if all
four of these hold, against W+DL on identical rows:

1. the upper 95% endpoint of ΔS_WIS is below zero;
2. ΔS_MAE has no 95% interval lying entirely above zero;
3. W+DLF meets all six §8 diagnostics;
4. no fold has a 95% paired daily-loss interval (W+DLF − W+DL) lying entirely above zero, in MAE
   or in WIS.

Otherwise, W+DL stands. If W+DL was not adopted, (W+DLF) − (W+DL) is reported descriptively
only.

**How the rules are applied.**

- Mechanically. They are never re-weighted, re-thresholded or overridden after results.
- Attribution arms are never eligible.
- A mixed result is reported as no demonstrated joint preference, never as equivalence.
- An INCOMPLETE or BLOCKED return yields no decision and nothing to publish.

**Always reported:**

- whether the replacement shows a joint improvement over v4, under §17.5's reading;
- R − M;
- the DL contrasts.

**What replacement means (Owner decision; PUBLISH_RULES 1.3, A10):**

- **A research status only.** v1 remains the released product and the demo. No final-product
  designation, freeze or Live follows (§16 is unchanged).
- **v4 keeps its number.** Its registry entry gains a dated revision, with the replacement as its
  current construction.
- **The three-block construction (CP-21's HGL) becomes the superseded revision.** Its evidence,
  MLflow records, comparator, result and limitations are kept unchanged and visible.
- **Naming, proposed:** "v4 · LightGBM member added" for the current revision. The superseded
  revision keeps "three-block LightGBM added" as its label.
- **The A3 transition "From v3 to v4"** describes the current revision and states the revision.
  CP-21's comparison remains the superseded revision's evidence.
- **The opponent.** From CP-22's landing, the standing decision "same information, same opponent"
  means v4's current revision. DDNN (§18) faces it.
- **4.7T.** Its frozen manifest carries v3, v4's three-block revision and v4's current revision.

### 20.7 Causal and integrity controls

§17.7's controls apply to PN and to every composite. They include the non-uniform D−1 mutation
for the normalized target and training-only selection for PN-sel. CP-22 adds:

- **Capacity-averaging identity:**
  - PN-avg equals the mean of its four full-window fits;
  - PN-sel's final fit equals the selected configuration's full-window fit, bit for bit;
  - averaging before and after the inversion agree within tolerance.
- **Composite parity.** For every composite, `c − (2/3)·c_HG = (1/3)·member` within tolerance, and
  every non-DL composite calls HG's H-layer code path.
- **Saved-vector identity.** Reused HGL, L-P, L-N and HG vectors match their committed blobs.
- **DL controls:**
  - **direction fixtures:** an all-miss day lowers `α_t` and widens its interval, and an all-hit
    day raises it;
  - the clipping bounds hold;
  - the recency weights sum to one;
  - the two-kernel weights reduce to DL's when the fast share is zero, and differ when it is
    not;
  - with equal weights, the weighted quantile equals the equal-weight quantile, and it differs
    when the weights differ;
  - **release rule:** D−1 errors are refused, every error is consumed once, and no partial day
    enters the buffer;
  - **positive control:** an injected level shift widens the intervals within the speed that
    `γ` and the half-life imply.
- **The boundary guard** after 2026-04-07, and **byte-exact storage** of hash-bound files.

### 20.8 Ceilings and calendar (D4)

These are maxima, not targets, derived from CP-21's measured costs:

- CP-21's 22,260 main fits came from 636 origins × 35 fits;
- its pooled fits took 2,047 single-thread seconds for 3,180 fits.

§17.8's rules on what counts and what happens at a cap apply.

| Dimension | Maximum |
|---|---|
| New models | 1 (PN). 0 other models, features, blocks, weights or seeds |
| Policies | 2 eligible (R, then M); 2 layer decisions in sequence (W+DL, then the add-on W+DLF); 6 attribution arms (A-PN-sel, A-LP, A-LN, W+ACI, v4+DL, v3+DL); saved references: v4, v3 and CP-21's seven |
| LightGBM fits | 6,000 main (nominal 638 × 8 = 5,104); 9,000 in total, including controls, reproduction, failures and repairs |
| HG components | Reuse the verified components. On a cache miss, or for the daily-cycle refits: at most 1,600 component-day attempts and 192,000 Lasso attempts |
| Replay | 16,000 new policy-days (recomputed for the added W+DLF: about two full passes) |
| References and uncertainty | 3 metric-only reference passes; 3 bootstrap passes of 2,000 replicates, including independent review |
| Compute | 30 aggregate machine-hours; at most 4 concurrent threads; BLAS 1; 0 GPU or cloud |
| Memory and disk | 10 GiB RSS; 10 GiB added peak disk |
| Data, network and cost | 0 bytes downloaded; 0 remote writes; $0 |
| Effort | About 24 active hours; hard ceiling of 32 |

**Before dependent work,** the Lead completes §14.6 E1–E4 for CP-22. An insufficient allowance
returns a concrete blocker, not a smaller experiment.

### 20.9 Publication packet and MLflow (D5)

§17.9 applies, with these changes:

- **Pinned rules:** PUBLISH_RULES 1.3, at the hash the issued brief records.
- **The packet:** `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-22/publication-packet.md`, completing every section
  of the packet template. It contains:
  - draft registry entries: v4's current revision (W or W+DL) and its superseded revision under
    A10; the study arms; comparator v4; population `common-10747h`;
  - the claim map `docs/track-b/research-content/cp22-claims.md`, with the ladder, the replacement
    and layer findings, and the withheld claims;
  - the derived quantities: the verdicts, the three rules and their date, the distance from v4,
    N (two eligible policies in a fixed sequence, plus two layer decisions in sequence), the
    ratio intervals and the per-fold MAE;
  - draft slot texts for the outcome the rules yield;
  - §5b and §5d marked not applicable;
  - §8's intended identities.
- **MLflow:**
  - the experiment is `delu-generations`;
  - local tracking only, in `.local/mlruns/cp22`: parent `cp22` and one child per new policy;
  - a draft export, `reports/v4-revision/mlflow-export-draft/cp22.json`;
  - the published set is unchanged, and there is no public write.
- **Public surfaces are unchanged in CP-22.**
- **Publication** follows the Owner's LAND as PRES-4, under PUBLISH_RULES 1.3. If there is no
  replacement, the Owner decides first.
- **Encoding.** v4 keeps D6's encoding: amber `#B45309`, a filled diamond and "v4".

### 20.10 Complete CP-22 acceptance checklist

All thirteen items are mandatory. Engineering PASS does not require a replacement: a complete,
valid "no replacement" result can pass.

1. **Verify the starting state** and preserve prior evidence and other sessions' work.
   - The ratified anchor, the amendment record and PUBLISH_RULES 1.3 are on `main`; verify their
     SHA-256 against the brief.
   - On `gauntlet/cp-22`, package the issued brief byte for byte as
     `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-22/issued-brief.md`.
   - Before any outer scoring, commit the frozen pre-run protocol:
     - the arms and members;
     - the grid, inner split and tie rule;
     - DL's half-life, `γ`, clipping and rearrangement, and the fast component's half-life and
       share, with their fixtures;
     - seeds, the manifest and cache identities;
     - budget accounting;
     - both rules' text.
2. **Verify the inputs.** Check the population and manifest identities and the frozen weather.
   Reuse HG and CP-21 vectors only with verified identity, and independently reproduce a
   representative HG and v4 slice. No retrieval, and nothing after 2026-04-07.
3. **Implement exactly PN, its two forms, the composites and DL,** with training-only selection
   for PN-sel. Prove the ladder's one-change-per-step property.
4. **Prove every control** of §20.7 and §17.7, each negative assertion paired with a positive
   control.
5. **Produce all 10,747 keys** for every new policy, with finite, ordered quantiles and the
   emitted p50 kept separate from the central forecast.
6. **Score every policy,** and independently verify the scores, the diagnostics, coverage with
   width, and all six §8 diagnostics for each new policy.
7. **Apply the three rules mechanically.** State the replacement (R, M or none) and the two layer
   decisions, each with its first unmet condition, and every §20.5 contrast with its reading. Keep
   the Engineering, research and product statuses distinct.
8. **Deliver §20.5's diagnostics,** including the Owner's investigation, to
   `reports/v4-revision/`.
9. **Enforce and report every §20.8 cap,** and respect the calendar.
10. **Supply the durable evidence** and executable reproduction commands, with byte-exact storage.
11. **Deliver §20.9's packet and draft export.** Public surfaces and the published export set
    stay unchanged; CI is green, and there is no public write.
12. **Obtain one fresh, independent Integration-Critic PASS** on a clean detached checkout of the
    final candidate. The review independently recomputes the metrics, intervals and both
    verdicts, representatively reproduces a PN selection, an average and a DL update, and
    re-derives the packet.
13. **Return the canonical packet** (templates §3) with the publication packet: both terminal
    SHAs, a verdict-only delta, resource totals, and branch and worktree accounting. Stop at
    CP-22's local result.

### 20.11 Paths and entry authority

**Write paths:**

- `src/cp22/`, `tests/cp22/`, `scripts/cp22_*.py`;
- `reports/v4-revision/`, `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-22/`;
- `docs/track-b/research-content/cp22-claims.md`;
- `scripts/mlflow_export.py` and its tests, only as the draft export needs;
- `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, only if a pinned dependency is missing. None is expected.

**Ignored material:** `.local/{worktrees,artifacts,tmp}/cp-22/` and `.local/mlruns/cp22`.

**Read-only:**

- CP-15, CP-16, CP-20 and CP-21 code and reports;
- `evidence/cp-21`;
- `.local/artifacts/cp-20/` and `.local/artifacts/cp-21/`.

**Preserve:** v1; all earlier evidence; the public surfaces; Q&A; `progress.md`; every locked
document.

**Roles.** The accountable executor is the CP-22 Engineering Lead. The reviewer is its fresh,
independent Integration Critic.

**Ratification and CP-22 execution authority: GRANTED by the Owner, 2026-10-01.** The grant
covers three things:

- CP-22's execution under this section and the issued brief;
- local `gauntlet/cp-22` candidate and evidence commits;
- exact packaging of the issued brief.

**Not authorized:** mainline operations, pushes, tags, publication, remote writes, data
retrieval, governance edits and later checkpoints.

### 20.12 Decisions recorded (Owner, 2026-10-01: "מאשר כפי שהמלצת")

| # | Decision | Ratified outcome |
|---|---|---|
| D1 | Shape | One checkpoint: two eligible policies in a fixed sequence (R, then M), plus attribution arms |
| D2 | Replacement rule | Non-inferiority against v4 (§20.6); if both fail, stop and return to the Owner |
| D3 | Representation | v4 keeps its number, with a dated revision; the three-block construction is kept as a superseded revision (PUBLISH_RULES 1.3, A10) |
| D4 | Ceilings | §20.8, about a third of CP-21's fits |
| D5 | Publication | PRES-4 after LAND, in every outcome with a replacement |
| D6 | Learned weight | Excluded; it stays in 4.8 |
| D7 | Interval calibration | In CP-22: DL on the winner, with its own rule. The Owner's dynamics decision sets its form (§20.3). The Owner then added a fast component, as an add-on decision that never replaces the 7-day memory (W+DLF, `cp22-fast-component`): "אני רוצה לבדוק האם נכון להוסיף משקל מהיר יותר בנוסף, לזיהוי שינויים חדים" |
| D8 | LEAR's internals | Diagnostics only; any change goes to a later, separate checkpoint |

### 20.13 Outcome and the Owner's decision (added in v21-r10)

**CP-22 returned PASS on 2026-10-04,** with an Integration PASS at `29d8d38`. It landed as
`land/cp-22` = `ebb7d42`, with `evidence/cp-22` = `8daf7d0`
([landing record](docs/track-b/cp-22-landing-2026-10-04.md)).

- **`cp22-replacement`: no replacement.** R and M met conditions 1–3 and failed condition 4. Fold
  4 (2025-05-01..07-29) is decisively worse than v4 for both, in MAE and in WIS.
- **`cp22-dynamic-layer` and `cp22-fast-component`** do not apply, because there is no winner W.

**The Owner's decision, 2026-10-04:** "v4 נשאר כפי שהוא".

- **§20.1 yields to the rule's result.** Its decisions "the new version replaces v4" and "the
  block split is removed in every outcome" do not take effect. The three-block construction
  remains v4's only revision, and A10 is not exercised.
- **The opponent.** "Same information, same opponent" names the three-block v4, and DDNN (§21)
  faces it.
- **No publication from the plan.** The PRES-4 plan's replacement publication is not entered,
  because its entry condition 3 is unmet.
- **The site's wording.** The v4 text was corrected on 2026-10-04, wording only, so that the
  block split is no longer put forward.

## 21. CP-23 — the DDNN route: v5 = v4 plus a DDNN member (v21-r10)

### 21.1 The question and the Owner's decisions

**The Owner's decisions, 2026-10-04:**

- **The candidate.** v5 = v4 plus a DDNN member: "v5 = v4 ועוד רכיב DDNN".
- **The opponent.** v4: "יתחרה כמובן מול V4". That is the three-block v4 (§20.13), on identical
  rows, with v3, A1 and B2 as references.
- **This section.** It is written under a Lockdown suspension.

**What CP-23 decides.** It runs programme 4.6 under §18 as one checkpoint, along its route:

1. **4.6L**, the provenance and licence record;
2. **4.6R**, training-only resource entry, after the correctness checks against PyTorch;
3. **4.6C**, one predefined comparison. It decides whether v5 is adopted in research
   (`cp23-adoption`, §21.6).

An entry failure at 4.6L or 4.6R ends the route before any evaluation fit:

- DDNN is NOT_ADMITTED;
- no comparison runs;
- the failure is reported to 4.7 (§18.4).

Engineering PASS requires neither admission nor adoption. A complete, valid NOT_ADMITTED or
not-adopted result can pass.

**Disclosed.** The Owner and the agents know the results of CP-15, CP-20, CP-21 and CP-22 on these
five folds. The Orchestrator's hindsight weight bound of 2026-10-04 (§22) is also known. CP-23's
results therefore stay `development_post_selection`, and 4.7T carries the protection.

### 21.2 DDNN, the candidate and the arms

**DDNN** is a feed-forward network with a Johnson SU distributional head for each delivery hour.
It is written in NumPy only (§18.2) and has these properties:

- **Information:** exactly v4's (§17.3). That covers `local_hour`, the three frozen GFS columns
  and their missing indicators, under §15.3's training-only imputation. The Lead fixes the
  representation, for example one row per delivery day with 24 outputs, in the protocol.
- **Target:** §4's normalized target. It is inverted to EUR/MWh with the origin's common center
  and scale, as L-N and PN are.
- **History and refits:** `[max(2019-01-01, D−728), D)`, with a fresh fit at every origin.
- **Early stopping:** on the window's last 28 calendar delivery days, which are training-only
  inner validation.
- **Configuration:**
  - The protocol freezes a finite set of at most four configurations, and a training-only
    selection rule in which a tie goes to the smaller configuration.
  - The configuration is chosen at most once per fold, before its first origin, from data before
    that origin only. It then stays fixed through the fold.
- **Ensemble:** a fixed number of seeds, at most four. The protocol fixes how members combine;
  quantile averaging is the default.
- **Emission:** the seven CP-15 quantiles and the p50, from the ensemble's JSU quantiles. The
  central forecast **D** is the ensemble's median. Crossing quantiles are restored by sorting, and
  every such case is recorded.

| ID | Role | Central forecast and intervals |
|---|---|---|
| v4 | Comparator: CP-21's saved HGL vectors | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·mean(L-N, L-R)`, H layer |
| v3, A1, B2 | References: saved vectors | As committed |
| v5 | The single eligible candidate | `(2/3)·c_v4 + (1/3)·D`, with HG's H layer re-estimated on v5's own errors |
| D | Study arm: DDNN alone, never eligible | D, with its own JSU quantiles and p50 |
| v3+D | Attribution: DDNN as v3's third member, never eligible | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·D`, H layer on its own errors |

**Fixed:**

- the one-third member weight;
- v4's components, bit for bit.

**Excluded:**

- learned or per-block weights, which belong to 4.8 (§22);
- new information, which belongs to stage 7 (§22);
- any other model family;
- TabPFN (§18.1).

### 21.3 NumPy only, and the PyTorch reference

§18.2 and §18.3 apply in full. CP-23 fixes four things.

- **The import audit.** An import audit proves that the DDNN code imports NumPy and the standard
  library only, and a fixture that imports a framework fails the audit.
- **Gradient checks.** Finite-difference checks cover the analytic gradients of the Johnson SU
  negative log-likelihood and of every layer.
- **The reference checks** compare against PyTorch on fixed inputs and seeds, at tolerances the
  protocol freezes before any comparison run:
  - the forward pass;
  - the JSU log-likelihood and its gradients;
  - short optimizer trajectories.
- **How the reference is installed and run.** PyTorch's CPU build is pinned in `uv.lock` as a
  test-only dependency, outside the runtime and default groups.
  - Its run, its versions and its result are recorded in the ledger.
  - A missing PyTorch fails the step; it is never a skip.
  - A failed check blocks every DDNN result until the NumPy code is fixed (§18.3).

### 21.4 The entry gates

**4.6L: provenance and licence.** The record goes to
`reports/distribution-challenger/licence-admission.md`.

- **Provenance.** It cites the method sources and confirms that no third-party code or weights
  were copied.
- **Licences.** It records the licence of each test-only dependency, with source, version and
  check date.
- **Uses.** It gives every use in the handoff's use table a disposition.
- **Stop.** If research use or reproducible retention is not permitted, or is unresolved, the
  route stops. The cap is 4 active hours.

**4.6R: training-only resource entry.** The record goes to
`reports/distribution-challenger/resource-admission.md`.

- **The data.** Training partitions only, with no evaluation-fold or reserved outcome.
- **The order.** The §21.3 checks pass first.
- **What it measures:**
  - peak memory;
  - fit and prediction time at the representative scale;
  - finite, ordered emission of the seven quantiles and the p50.
- **The projection.** It projects the full run against §21.8 and finishes PASS or NOT_ADMITTED,
  with the cause.
- **No smaller experiment.** A projection above a ceiling is NOT_ADMITTED, with a concrete
  blocker. It does not lead to a smaller experiment.

**Before any evaluation fit,** the Lead commits the frozen pre-run protocol:

- DDNN's representation, architecture family, configuration set and selection rule;
- the early-stopping rule, ensemble size, seeds and quantile construction;
- the reference tolerances;
- the arms;
- budget accounting;
- the rule's text.

### 21.5 Population, metrics and diagnostics

**The population.** §20.4 applies:

- 10,747 keys, 638 origins and the genuine warm-up starts;
- forecast origin D−1 11:00 UTC;
- released errors at D−2 or earlier, each consumed once;
- weather only from CP-20's retained grids;
- nothing after 2026-04-07;
- reused vectors only when they match their committed blobs.

v5 and v3+D take their warm-up errors from DDNN fits at the warm-up origins, inside §21.8's
caps.

**Metrics and uncertainty.** §20.5's apply:

- the emitted p50's S_MAE and S_WIS, equal-fold and B0-normalized;
- the shared 2,000-replicate CP-20 index set, with seed 15042 and 7-day blocks within folds;
- ratio intervals;
- per-fold paired daily-loss intervals;
- all six §8 diagnostics;
- coverage with width;
- the stress period and the peak.

**Contrasts,** each read under §17.5:

| Contrast | Role |
|---|---|
| v5 − v4 | The adoption decision (§21.6) |
| v5 − v3 | Reference |
| D − v4, D − v3 | DDNN alone, descriptive |
| (v3+D) − v3, beside v4 − v3 | DDNN against LightGBM as v3's third member |
| v5 − (v3+D) | Whether LightGBM still adds once DDNN is present |

**Diagnostics.** They are descriptive and choose nothing:

- DDNN's own calibration: coverage by level and the PIT histogram;
- extrapolation: forecasts against the training-window maximum on extreme days, beside CP-22's
  tree record;
- the 2022 peak and fold 4;
- ensemble and seed stability;
- the configuration chosen in each fold;
- fit cost, and a cold daily cycle at 20 or more origins stratified across folds.

They are written to `reports/distribution-challenger/`.

### 21.6 Pre-registered rule `cp23-adoption`, set 2026-10-04

v5 is adopted in research as v5 if, and only if, all four of these hold against v4 on identical
rows:

1. **Joint improvement over v4.** On the paired v5 − v4 differences, the upper 95% endpoint of
   ΔS_WIS is < 0 and the upper 95% endpoint of ΔS_MAE is ≤ 0.
2. **No regression.** v5 meets all six original §8 diagnostics.
3. **A complete, valid evaluation.** Engineering PASS with a fresh binding Integration verdict,
   and all 10,747 keys issued with finite, ordered quantiles.
4. **No resolved per-fold degradation.** No fold has a 95% paired daily-loss interval
   (v5 − v4) lying entirely above zero, in MAE or in WIS.

**Otherwise,** v5 is not adopted. CP-23 becomes the branch "DDNN member on v4", with the first
unmet condition and its values as the reason. If DDNN fails entry, there is no comparison and no
adoption decision.

**How the rule is applied:**

- mechanically, never re-weighted, re-thresholded or overridden after results;
- D and v3+D are never eligible;
- a mixed result is no demonstrated joint preference, never equivalence;
- an INCOMPLETE or BLOCKED return yields no decision and nothing to publish.

**What adoption means:**

- **A research status.** v1 remains the released product and the demo, and no designation,
  freeze or Live follows (§16).
- **The opponent.** At CP-23's landing, "same information, same opponent" comes to name v5.
- **4.7T.** Its frozen manifest carries v3, v4 and v5.
- **Naming, proposed:**
  - adopted: "v5 · DDNN member added", with predecessor v4. The A3 transition is titled "From v4
    to v5: adding a distributional neural network";
  - not adopted: the branch "DDNN member on v4".

### 21.7 Causal and integrity controls

§17.7's controls and §20.7's applicable ones apply to DDNN, v5 and v3+D. Each negative assertion
is paired with a positive control.

**Leakage and selection:**

- delivery-day and future masking change nothing;
- a non-uniform D−1 price mutation moves the forecast;
- future weather changes nothing;
- a validation-outcome mutation can change early stopping and the configuration choice, while
  evaluation outcomes cannot.

**DDNN:**

- the import audit and the gradient checks (§21.3);
- the reference checks, at the frozen tolerances;
- determinism: a fixed seed reproduces a fit bit for bit on the same machine, or within a
  tolerance it measures and records;
- restart replay;
- every emitted quantile finite and ordered, with each rearrangement recorded.

**Composites:** `c_v5 − (2/3)·c_v4 = (1/3)·D` within tolerance, and v5 and v3+D run on HG's
H-layer code path.

**Identity and storage:**

- reused HGL, HG, A1 and B2 vectors match their committed blobs;
- an independent representative HG and v4 slice is reproduced;
- the boundary guard after 2026-04-07;
- byte-exact storage of hash-bound files.

### 21.8 Ceilings and calendar (D4)

These are maxima, not targets. 4.6R projects the full run against them.

| Dimension | Maximum |
|---|---|
| New models | 1 (DDNN). 0 other families, information, features or learned weights |
| Policies | 1 eligible (v5); 2 study and attribution arms (D, v3+D); saved references v4, v3, A1 and B2 |
| DDNN member fits | 4,000 in the main run; 6,000 in total, including 4.6R, controls, reproduction, failures and review |
| Replay | 8,000 new policy-days |
| References and uncertainty | 3 metric-only reference passes; 3 bootstrap passes of 2,000 replicates, including independent review |
| Compute | 60 aggregate machine-hours; at most 4 concurrent workers; BLAS 1; CPU only; no GPU, MPS or cloud |
| Memory and disk | 10 GiB RSS; 10 GiB added peak disk |
| Data, network and cost | 0 data bytes downloaded. The one permitted download is the pinned PyTorch CPU test dependency, from PyPI, with its licence recorded in 4.6L. 0 remote writes; $0 |
| Effort | About 30 active hours; hard ceiling of 40 |

**Before dependent work,** the Lead completes §14.6 E1–E4 for CP-23. An insufficient allowance
returns a concrete blocker, not a smaller experiment.

### 21.9 Publication packet and MLflow

§17.9 applies, with these changes:

- **Pinned rules:** PUBLISH_RULES 1.3, at the hash the issued brief records.
- **The packet:** `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-23/publication-packet.md`, completing every section
  of the packet template. It contains:
  - draft registry entries: v5 adopted, or the not-adopted branch; the study arms; comparator v4;
    population `common-10747h`;
  - the claim map `docs/track-b/research-content/cp23-claims.md`, with the withheld claims;
  - the derived quantities: the verdict, the rule and its date, the distance from v4, N (one
    candidate), the ratio intervals and the per-fold MAE;
  - draft slot texts for the outcome the rule yields, including the v4 → v5 transition (A3) if
    v5 is adopted;
  - §5b and §5d marked not applicable;
  - §8's intended identities.
- **MLflow:**
  - the experiment is `delu-generations`;
  - local tracking only, in `.local/mlruns/cp23`;
  - a draft export, `reports/distribution-challenger/mlflow-export-draft/cp23.json`;
  - the published set is unchanged, and there is no public write.
- **Public surfaces are unchanged in CP-23.**
- **Publication** follows the Owner's LAND, as the next publication under PUBLISH_RULES 1.3.
  - Before its brief, the Owner sets v5's encoding (PUBLISH_RULES §14) and decides automation
    items 6 and 7 (§22).
  - If v5 is not adopted, the Owner decides whether the branch is published.

### 21.10 Complete CP-23 acceptance checklist

All sixteen items are mandatory. Engineering PASS does not require admission or adoption: a
complete, valid NOT_ADMITTED or not-adopted result can pass.

1. **Verify the starting state** and preserve prior evidence and other sessions' work.
   - Verify the ratified anchor's SHA-256 against the brief.
   - Record the baseline with `scripts/gauntlet.py start cp-23`.
   - On `gauntlet/cp-23`, package the issued brief byte for byte as
     `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-23/issued-brief.md`.
2. **Complete 4.6L,** with every use dispositioned. Stop at its cap, or if research use is not
   permitted.
3. **Prove the code's correctness under §21.3:**
   - the NumPy-only import audit;
   - finite-difference gradient checks;
   - the PyTorch reference checks, passing at the frozen tolerances and installed so that they
     cannot be skipped silently.
4. **Complete 4.6R** on training data only, with the measured values, the projection against
   §21.8, and PASS or NOT_ADMITTED with its cause. On NOT_ADMITTED, stop, with no comparison,
   and report to 4.7.
5. **Commit the frozen pre-run protocol** (§21.4) before any evaluation fit.
6. **Verify the inputs:**
   - population, manifest and frozen weather;
   - saved-vector identities;
   - an independent representative HG and v4 slice;
   - no retrieval, and nothing after 2026-04-07.
7. **Implement exactly DDNN, v5 and the arms,** with training-only selection and early stopping,
   and prove composite parity.
8. **Prove every control** of §21.7 and the inherited ones, each negative paired with a positive.
9. **Produce all 10,747 keys** for every new policy, with finite, ordered quantiles and the
   emitted p50 kept separate from the central forecast.
10. **Score every policy,** and independently verify the scores, the diagnostics, coverage with
    width, and all six §8 diagnostics for each new policy.
11. **Apply `cp23-adoption` mechanically.** State the decision with its first unmet condition,
    and every §21.5 contrast with its reading. Keep the Engineering, research and product
    statuses distinct.
12. **Deliver §21.5's diagnostics** to `reports/distribution-challenger/`.
13. **Enforce and report every §21.8 cap,** and respect the calendar.
14. **Supply the durable evidence,** executable reproduction commands and byte-exact storage.
    Deliver §21.9's packet and draft export. Public surfaces and the published export set stay
    unchanged, CI is green, and there is no public write.
15. **Obtain one fresh, independent Integration-Critic PASS** on a clean detached checkout of
    the final candidate. Launch it with `scripts/gauntlet.py critic-open`, `critic-brief` and
    `critic-close`. The review independently:
    - recomputes the metrics, intervals and the verdict;
    - reruns the reference checks;
    - reproduces a representative DDNN fit, its ensemble and its quantile emission;
    - re-derives the packet.
16. **Return the canonical packet** (templates §3), checked with `scripts/gauntlet.py return`.
    It carries:
    - both terminal SHAs and the verdict-only delta;
    - resource totals;
    - branch, worktree and stash accounting.

    Stop at CP-23's local result.

### 21.11 Paths and entry authority

**Write paths:**

- `src/cp23/`, `tests/cp23/`, `scripts/cp23_*.py`;
- `reports/distribution-challenger/`, `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-23/`;
- `docs/track-b/research-content/cp23-claims.md`;
- `scripts/mlflow_export.py` and its tests, only as the draft export needs;
- `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`, only for the pinned, test-only PyTorch reference.

**Ignored material:** `.local/{worktrees,artifacts,tmp}/cp-23/` and `.local/mlruns/cp23`.

**Read-only:**

- CP-15, CP-16, CP-20, CP-21 and CP-22 code and reports;
- `evidence/cp-21` and `evidence/cp-22`;
- `.local/artifacts/cp-20/`, `cp-21/` and `cp-22/`.

**Preserve:** v1; all earlier evidence; the public surfaces; Q&A; `progress.md`; every locked
document.

**Roles.** The accountable executor is the CP-23 Engineering Lead. The reviewer is its fresh,
independent Integration Critic.

**Ratification: GRANTED by the Owner, 2026-10-04** (the header's authority). **CP-23's
execution: not yet granted.** It needs the Owner's explicit grant, with the issued brief. That
grant would cover three things:

- CP-23's execution under this section and the brief;
- local `gauntlet/cp-23` candidate and evidence commits;
- exact packaging of the issued brief.

**Never authorized here:**

- mainline operations, pushes and tags;
- publication and remote writes;
- data retrieval, beyond the pinned test dependency;
- governance edits;
- later checkpoints.

### 21.12 Decisions recorded, 2026-10-04

| # | Decision | Set by | Ratified outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | The candidate | Owner | v5 = v4 plus a DDNN member |
| D2 | The opponent | Owner | The three-block v4 on identical rows; v3, A1 and B2 as references |
| D3 | This anchor | Owner | v21-r10, under a suspension, recording CP-22's outcome (§20.13) |
| D4 | The member weight | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | One third, as CP-21 added LightGBM: `(2/3)·c_v4 + (1/3)·D`. Fixed, never tuned; learned weights stay in 4.8 |
| D5 | Shape | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | One checkpoint running 4.6L → 4.6R → 4.6C with gates; entry failure ends it before any evaluation fit |
| D6 | Intervals | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | v5 and v3+D use HG's H layer on their own errors; DDNN alone uses its own JSU quantiles |
| D7 | The rule | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | `cp23-adoption`: CP-21's four conditions, against v4 |
| D8 | Ceilings | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | §21.8 |
| D9 | The reference tests | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | PyTorch CPU, pinned and test-only, run and recorded, never skipped silently |
| D10 | Publication | Orchestrator, under the Owner's grant | The next publication after LAND if v5 is adopted; the Owner sets v5's encoding first |
| D11 | The programme order | Owner | §22 |

### 21.13 Outcome (added in v21-r11)

**CP-23 returned PASS on 2026-10-04,** with an Integration PASS at `f9a737e`. It landed as
`land/cp-23` = `03c5b64`, with `evidence/cp-23` = `928bc13`
([landing record](docs/track-b/cp-23-landing-2026-10-04.md)).

- **Entry.** DDNN passed 4.6L, the §21.3 checks (26 of 26 reference checks) and 4.6R.
- **`cp23-adoption`: v5 is not adopted.** Condition 1 is the first unmet, against v4:
  ΔS_MAE +0.0064 [−0.0016, +0.0149] and ΔS_WIS +0.0071 [−0.0009, +0.0138]. Condition 4 is also
  unmet: fold 3 is decisively worse in MAE, +1.92 [0.30, 4.40] EUR/MWh.
- **The branch.** CP-23 is the branch "DDNN member on v4". v4 stays the research base, and "same
  information, same opponent" still names the three-block v4.
- **The Owner's two rulings during the run** (PUBLISH_RULES 1.3's pin, and the PyTorch reference
  in its own test-only lock) governed CP-23. v21-r10's bytes stand as ratified, and §23 applies
  both lessons.
- **What follows.** DDNN-2 (§23), under the Owner's delegation of 2026-10-04.

## 22. Programme order after CP-22 (Owner, 2026-10-04)

The Owner approved this order on 2026-10-04 ("הסדר המאושר", then "בצע"). It amends the
handoff's sequence only as stated here.

1. **Automation, done 2026-10-04.**
   - Items 2, 1, 5, 3, 4 and 8 of `docs/automation-plan.md` were implemented in commit
     `42e4ceb`.
   - Item 3 was created under the Owner's task-scoped suspension of the same day.
   - Templates §4's receipt list governs (the Owner's ruling).
2. **CP-23, DDNN (§21).**
3. **Immediately after DDNN: a comprehensive data-admission research, together with 4.4V.**
   - **Scope, in the Owner's words:** energy prices, interest rates, the local stock market's fear
     index, and "כל מה שאפשר וחוקי לשלוף וללמוד ממנו". The research covers at least:
     - gas (TTF and alternatives), oil, coal and carbon (EUA);
     - central-bank rates;
     - a German volatility index;
     - neighbouring-zone and cross-border inputs;
     - outages;
     - wind, solar and load forecasts.
   - **Late publication.** For an input published after the 11:00 UTC origin, the research tests
     two routes. One is an earlier vintage that already covers the delivery day, for example a
     forecast for day D published at 18:00 on D−2. The other is a provider that publishes before
     the origin. It also assesses an external wind and solar forecast API, available and
     reliable, as an alternative to building 4.4V's own model.
   - **Admission checks.** Every input must pass CP-15's five admission checks
     (`reports/cp15/feasibility/structural_inputs.md`). They require, for both research and the
     final product's daily operation:
     - a licence;
     - an `available_at` vintage;
     - missingness;
     - an imputation rule;
     - coverage from 2019 with redistribution rights.
   - **Desk research first.** Any retrieval or purchase is the Owner's decision. Admitted inputs
     then go to a pre-registered ablation checkpoint.
4. **4.8, recombination with a meta-learner.**
   - **The candidate.** A small NumPy network, on DDNN's infrastructure, that predicts each
     member's weight from regime features.
   - **How it learns.** Walk-forward only: at each origin it learns from released errors and
     features available then, and its design is frozen before scoring.
   - **What it faces,** under a pre-registered rule:
     - the fixed weights;
     - per-block weights, which the Owner filed on 2026-10-04;
     - weights from recent errors.
   - **Disclosed in advance.** The Orchestrator's hindsight bound for the LightGBM weight is
     known: per block −0.8% and per fold and block −1.6% pooled central MAE. It is an oracle, not
     selectable.
5. **4.7T,** then CP-17–CP-19.

**Binding reminders:**

- **Before the next publication's brief is issued,** the Orchestrator brings automation items 6
  (post-deploy publication receipt) and 7 (pre-review check runner) to the Owner for a decision.
  The brief waits for that decision.
- **Before CP-18's daily pipeline,** which handles credentials every day, the Orchestrator brings
  back the security items of the archived proposal `archive/deterministic-migration-plan-20261001`:
  - a value-free leak scan;
  - a lint for bare environment reads;
  - GitHub rulesets.

## 23. CP-24 — DDNN-2: a literature-faithful DDNN, and v5 = v4 plus a DDNN-2 member (v21-r11)

### 23.1 The question, the delegation and the evidence class

**The question.** CP-23's DDNN was admitted but did not help v4 (§21.13). CP-24 asks whether a
DDNN built as the published work builds it can serve the programme as a member of v4. Such a DDNN
uses one row per delivery day, a real training-only search, and an ensemble of tuned
configurations trained up to the day before each forecast. This is the Owner's goal (header).

**What CP-24 decides,** in one checkpoint:

1. the entry gates (§23.7);
2. the per-fold training-only search and a pre-fold gate that must pass before any DDNN-2 or
   new-policy fit at a warm-up or evaluation origin (§23.4, §23.6);
3. at most two pre-registered scored attempts. Each decides `cp24-adoption` (§23.9) for one
   candidate:

   v5 = (2/3)·c_HG + (1/6)·L + (1/6)·D2.

**Engineering PASS requires neither admission nor adoption.** A complete, valid result can pass
in any of three forms:

- NOT_ADMITTED;
- stopped at the pre-fold gate;
- not adopted.

**Its place in §22's order.** CP-24 runs within §22's item 2 (DDNN), before item 3, by the
Owner's delegation of 2026-10-04. §22 is otherwise unchanged.

**The roles under the delegation:**

- an independent research agent proposed the directions;
- the Orchestrator wrote this section and the brief;
- an independent plan critic reviewed them against the repository;
- the CP-24 Engineering Lead executes them in its own worktree, with one fresh Integration
  Critic;
- the Orchestrator steers only at the points §23.6 names;
- the Owner lands by hand.

**Disclosed.** Everyone involved knows the results of CP-15, CP-16 and CP-20 to CP-23 on these
five folds, including CP-23's descriptive diagnosis and its hindsight weight bound of 0.05–0.10.

- **Partly fold-motivated.** The research agent's diagnosis read CP-23's fold-level tables, so
  DDNN-2's design is partly motivated by fold outcomes. The design is kept at the level of
  literature-backed mechanisms, and no fold-specific value is used.
- **Evidence class.** DDNN-2 is the second DDNN decision on the same folds. Its results stay
  `development_post_selection`, and 4.7T carries the protection.

### 23.2 Why a second design

CP-23's DDNN differed from the published DDNN (Marcjasz, Narajewski, Weron and Ziel, 2023) and
the epftoolbox DNN (Lago, Marcjasz, De Schutter and Weron, 2021) in five ways. Each is read from
CP-23's committed code and tables in the research report
([cp-24-research-directions-2026-10-05.md](docs/track-b/cp-24-research-directions-2026-10-05.md)).

1. **Training.** Each fit trained on `[D−728, D−28)` and early-stopped on the negative
   log-likelihood (NLL) of `[D−28, D)`. Its median best epoch was 3–8, and there was no refit:
   - it never trained on the last 28 days, while LEAR and LightGBM refit on their whole window;
   - on identical inputs it was worse than LightGBM in every fold.
2. **Representation.** It used one row per delivery hour with same-hour lags. It saw the previous
   evening only inside rolling statistics, never as hourly prices. Its errors correlated 0.83
   with LightGBM's.
3. **Selection.** One configuration out of four was chosen per fold, on a 28-day holdout with
   margins of 0.03–4.9%.
4. **Ensemble.** It averaged four seeds of one configuration, and the mean let one member's
   blow-up through.
5. **Role.** Only its median entered v5, at one third: more weight than LightGBM, its
   better-performing twin.

**This diagnosis selects nothing.** It explains why the design changes. DDNN-2's settings are made
on training data only (§23.4).

### 23.3 DDNN-2: what is fixed

- **Code.** §18.2, §18.3 and §21.3 apply, including to the search: NumPy and the standard library
  only, and analytic gradients, with PyTorch as a test-only reference. The one exception is
  §21.3's root `uv.lock` pin, which §23.7's test-only lock replaces (the Owner's ruling of
  2026-10-04, §21.13).
- **Information.** Exactly v4's sources (§17.3), in DDNN-2's day-level form, as §21.2 already
  permits for a DDNN.
  - **What does not bind.** §17.3's and §15.2's per-hour restrictions on cross-hour weather
    expansion and feature search do not bind DDNN-2. §23.4's inclusion flags choose among these
    sources on training data only, and add none.
  - **The subset used:**
    - the D−1, D−2, D−3 and D−7 price curves;
    - the TSO day-ahead load forecasts for D, D−1 and D−7;
    - the three frozen GFS columns for D and their missing indicators (§15.3);
    - CP-15's LightGBM price statistics at the origin. Over 168 hours: the rolling mean, SD, 5%,
      50% and 95% quantiles, and the negative-price count. Over 720 hours: the rolling mean and
      SD;
    - v4's calendar features: LEAR's weekday dummies and CP-15's LightGBM calendar set, in any
      encoding of the same information.
  - **Vintages.** Every input keeps its inherited vintage assumption: CP-15's A65 load forecasts,
    and CP-20's GFS availability rule. Nothing else enters.
- **Representation.** One row per delivery day D, with whole-day inputs by Europe/Berlin local
  hour, under the LEAR design's convention in `src/cp15/data.py`. A repeated local hour averages
  its two observations, and a missing local hour stays missing until training-only imputation.
  - **Outputs:** 24 local hours × 4 Johnson SU parameters, in CP-23's parameterisation
    (`src/cp23/ddnn.py`): ξ = o₁, λ = softplus(o₂) + 10⁻³, γ = o₃, δ = softplus(o₄) + 0.05.
  - **The loss** covers the present target hours only. A 23-hour day masks its missing slot. On a
    25-hour day the repeated local hour's target is the mean of its two observations.
  - **Emission** issues exactly the day's keys, as A1_w and B2_w issue them. On a 25-hour day,
    both keys of the repeated hour receive that slot's forecast.
- **Target.** Each row's target and price inputs are normalised with that row's own origin
  statistics (§4), from prices delivered up to the day before. The search chooses among four
  forms (§23.4). Quantiles are inverted with the forecast origin's statistics.
- **Window and refits.** A fresh fit of every member at every origin, on
  `[max(2019-01-01, D−728), D)`. Optional recency weights belong to the search.
- **Recency is never dropped.** Each member early-stops on its own seeded random 20% of the
  window's whole calendar weeks. The holdout pool excludes the most recent 7 days, so every
  member trains on the days up to D−1 that are outside its own held-out weeks.
- **Stopping and loss.**
  - The stopping metric is the mean pinball loss over the seven scored levels, never the NLL.
  - Patience is 50 epochs, the maximum is 1,000, and the best epoch is kept.
  - Training starts with 20 NLL epochs, then minimises κ·NLL + (1 − κ)·the mean pinball loss
    over a 19-level grid that contains the seven scored levels. The search chooses κ.
  - Best-epoch tracking and patience start after the 20 warm-start epochs.
- **Guards.**
  - Every continuous input is winsorised at its training rows' 0.5% and 99.5% quantiles. Binary
    inputs and missing indicators are never winsorised.
  - Emitted quantiles are capped at ±1.25 times the largest absolute value of the member's
    normalised target z on its training rows, before any asinh.
  - Crossings are restored by sorting.

  Every activation of a guard is recorded.
- **Ensemble.** Each fold uses its four best configurations (§23.4), with two seeds each: eight
  member fits per origin.
  - Members combine by the per-level median of their quantiles in EUR/MWh. With eight members,
    that is the mean of the two middle values.
  - The p50 and the central forecast D2 are that median.
  - The ensemble is fixed through the fold, from its first origin.

### 23.4 The training-only search

- **When and from what.** Once per fold f, before its warm-up start D0_f, by a procedure
  identical for every fold. Every search fit trains on data before its batch, so nothing dated on
  or after D0_f − 56 enters. §23.6's weather-coverage rule applies.
- **Validation batches.** Consecutive 28-day blocks tile backward from D0_f − 57, the day before
  the gate window.
  - A block that meets any fold's warm-up or evaluation day, or that starts before 2020-01-01, is
    skipped.
  - B_f = min(11, the blocks kept), taking the most recent. This gives B = 3, 7, 11, 11 and 11
    for folds 1–5.
  - The protocol records every batch's dates.
- **One fit per trial and batch.** Each trial is fitted once per batch, with a recorded fixed
  seed, on `[max(2019-01-01, b − 728), b)`, where b is the batch's first day. That fit then
  forecasts the batch's 28 days, as the published batch-rolling scheme does.
- **The sampler.** Seeded random search, written in NumPy, with 32 to 128 trials per fold per
  round. 4.6R′'s record fixes the number.
  - Successive halving: every trial runs on the min(4, B_f) most recent batches, and the best
    third runs on all B_f.
  - The ranking metric is the mean seven-level pinball loss in EUR/MWh, after inversion, over the
    batches each trial ran. MAE is reported beside it.
  - The fold's ensemble is the four best distinct configurations among the trials that ran all
    B_f batches, ranked over those batches. Ties go to the network with fewer parameters.
- **The space,** within these bounds (the protocol fixes the exact space and priors):

  | Hyperparameter | Range |
  |---|---|
  | Hidden layers | 1 or 2 |
  | Width | 16–512 units (log scale) |
  | Activation | ELU, ReLU, softplus or tanh |
  | Input dropout | Off, or 0.05–0.5 |
  | L1 and L2 rates | Each off, or on a log scale |
  | Adam learning rate | 1e-4–1e-2 (log scale) |
  | Batch size | 32, 64 or 128 |
  | Loss weight κ | 1, 0.5 or 0 |
  | Recency half-life | None, 365 or 180 days |
  | Optional input groups | Inclusion flags for the D−2, D−3 and D−7 prices, the D−1 and D−7 load forecasts, the GFS block, the origin price statistics, and the day-type and month encodings |
  | Target transform | z or asinh(z), where z is centred and scaled either by §4's level and scale, or by the median and MAD of the last 168 hours with a floor (Uniejewski, Weron and Ziel, 2018) |

  The D−1 prices and D's load forecast always enter.
- **What fold f's search never does:**
  - read any outcome dated on or after D0_f − 56, which covers fold f's gate window, its warm-up
    and its evaluation;
  - narrow its space after any fold score exists, except as §23.6 allows attempt 2.

  Like every production fit, a search fit trains on all history before its batch. That history
  includes earlier folds' warm-up and evaluation days, but no validation batch contains such a
  day.

### 23.5 The candidate, the arms and the references

| ID | Role | Central forecast and intervals |
|---|---|---|
| v4 | Comparator: CP-21's saved HGL vectors | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·L`, H layer, as committed |
| v3 | Reference: saved vectors | As committed |
| A1, B2 | References: CP-15's no-weather LEAR models, as in CP-23 | As committed |
| D | Reference: CP-23's DDNN, saved vectors (`evidence/cp-23`) | As committed |
| v5 | The single eligible candidate of every attempt | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/6)·L + (1/6)·D2`, with HG's H layer re-estimated on v5's own errors |
| D2 | Study arm: DDNN-2 alone, never eligible | D2, with its own Johnson SU quantiles and p50 |
| v3+D2 | Attribution: DDNN-2 in LightGBM's place, never eligible | `(2/3)·c_HG + (1/3)·D2`, H layer on its own errors |

c_HG is the mean of HG's weather components A1_w and B2_w (§17.2). L is v4's LightGBM member,
`mean(L-N, L-R)`. Both come from the saved vectors.

**The weight.** v4 gives two thirds to LEAR and one third to LightGBM, with equal weights for the
members inside each third. DDNN-2 joins LightGBM's third by the same rule. The weight is fixed
before any fit and is never estimated on any data. Two properties follow:

- `c_v5 − c_v4 = (1/6)·(D2 − L)`;
- LEAR keeps its two thirds.

The weight never changes in CP-24.

**Excluded:**

- learned, per-block or per-fold weights, and any weight estimated on outcomes (4.8, §22);
- new information (stage 7);
- other model families, a per-hour network family, and TabPFN;
- DDNN-2's distribution as v5's interval provider, which stays descriptive (§23.8).

### 23.6 Steering, the pre-fold gate and the scored attempts

**The pre-fold gate.** Each fold has a gate window G_f = [D0_f − 56, D0_f):

- 2020-03-30..2020-05-24;
- 2020-12-29..2021-02-22;
- 2022-03-30..2022-05-24;
- 2025-01-25..2025-03-21;
- 2025-10-07..2025-12-01.

Together they make 280 days, none of them a warm-up or evaluation day of any fold.

**What runs on each gate day.** On each gate day D the Lead issues two sets of forecasts, each
from a fresh fit at that day's origin:

- DDNN-2, with the round's ensemble for the fold;
- v4's members, with their unchanged code: A1_w and B2_w through `cp21.components`, and L-N and
  L-R through CP-21's code.

**Proving v4's code path.** The members' committed vectors are reproduced:

- A1_w and B2_w are the `A1` and `B2` columns of
  `reports/distribution-challenger/members.parquet`;
- L-N and L-R are in `reports/block-challenger/predictions.parquet`.

Each gate fit trains on all history before D, as production does, including earlier folds'
warm-up and evaluation days. Nothing of fold f on or after D0_f is read.

**Weather coverage of pre-fold fits.** CP-20's retained grids cover every warm-up and evaluation
window, but not every date. Delivery days 2022-09-29..2023-03-24 have no frozen weather record,
and §15.3 makes unattempted weather BLOCKED, never imputed.

- **The rule.** Every pre-fold fit leaves out of its training window every delivery day that has
  no frozen weather record, whatever its input groups. Pre-fold fits are 4.6R′, the search and
  the gate. No other window changes.
- **Where it applies.** It affects fold 4's 56 gate days and the batches of folds 4 and 5 whose
  windows reach back before 2023-03-25.
- **v4's members on those gate days** run their unchanged code through a scoped, logged wrapper.
  The wrapper marks the uncovered days ineligible before the call. Its parity with the committed
  vectors is proven at covered origins, where it changes nothing.
- **Limits.** No warm-up or evaluation fit is affected, and no weather is retrieved.
- **Reporting.** The pre-fold report states the excluded training days of every fit.

**The gate passes if all four of these hold,** pooled over the 280 days as point estimates:

- **G0:** every forecast is finite and ordered;
- **G1:** v5's central MAE ≤ v4's central MAE, both built from the gate-day members;
- **G2:** D2's MAE ≤ 1.10 × L's MAE;
- **G3:** the quantile cap binds on fewer than 0.1% of the members' emitted hour-levels.

The gate is a screen, not a claim. It can only prevent a fold look.

**Rounds.** A round is one search per fold, then the gate, then a pre-fold report. The report
covers:

- the search ledger, and each fold's ensemble and validation scores;
- the gate table, by fold and pooled;
- the error correlations of D2 with HG and L on the gate days;
- the excluded training days;
- the costs.

No DDNN-2 or new-policy fit is made at a warm-up or evaluation origin in a round. Reproducing
v4's or HG's committed vectors at those origins is not such a fit, because it reads no outcome
that is not already committed. That covers item 2's slice, the gate's code-path proof and the
wrapper's parity check. There are at most three rounds before
attempt 1 and one round before attempt 2. Between rounds the design may change within
§23.3–§23.4, as S1 decides on the Lead's proposal.

**S1: the Orchestrator's steering after each round.** One of three answers:

- **freeze** the latest round's design, only if that round's gate passed;
- **another round,** with named changes within §23.3–§23.4, on pre-fold evidence only;
- **stop.**

A failed gate in the last round allowed before an attempt means that attempt cannot run.

- **Before attempt 1,** a stop or an attempt that cannot run ends CP-24 as "stopped at the
  pre-fold gate", with no fold look.
- **Before attempt 2,** the same ends the route with attempt 1's result. CP-24's outcome is then
  the branch "DDNN-2 member on v4", with attempt 1's first unmet condition, and attempt 2 is
  recorded as stopped at its gate.

**The freeze and scored attempt k.**

- The Lead commits the attempt's frozen protocol (§23.7) before its first warm-up or evaluation
  fit.
- Then come the warm-up and evaluation fits, the policies, and one scoring of all five folds.
- The fitting and scoring entry points refuse to run unless attempt k's frozen protocol is
  committed and unchanged.

**S2: the Orchestrator's steering after attempt 1,** if attempt 1 is not adopted.

- **When attempt 1 counts as not adopted.** Any of conditions 1, 2, 4 or 5 is unmet on its
  committed scores, or a completeness clause of condition 3 is. Condition 3's Integration clause
  is applied at the end, and never by itself triggers attempt 2.
- **The answer** is one of two:
  - stop;
  - attempt 2, once, with named design changes and the recorded diagnosis behind them. Attempt 2
    then runs its one round and must pass the gate.

**Budget at each step.** Before each round and each attempt, the Lead projects it against every
remaining ceiling, including the review reserve, and starts it only if it fits. A step that does
not fit is not available at S1 or S2.

**Bounds that no steering moves:**

- **Attempts.** At most two scored attempts. Each scores the folds once. A repair after scoring
  that changes any frozen element is a new attempt.
- **What attempt 2 may change.** Only DDNN-2's design within §23.3–§23.4:
  - the inputs, the transform, the loss, the training recipe, the guards or the ensemble;
  - the search's sampler, trial budget or priors, or a wider space.

  Its search reruns from scratch on pre-fold data. It never narrows the space, never removes a
  configuration that attempt 1's folds disfavoured, and never seeds a trial from attempt 1's
  ensembles. It never changes:
  - the weight or v5's formula;
  - the comparator, the population, the metrics, the gate or the rule.
- **No outcome-tuned quantity.** No attempt sets any quantity to a value estimated on any warm-up
  or evaluation outcome, for example a hindsight weight. Anything tuned is tuned on data before
  D0_f:
  - the search, on data before D0_f − 56;
  - S1's choices, on the search ledgers and the gate results, which end at D0_f − 1.
- **After an adoption,** no further attempt runs.
- **Nothing else in §23 changes during CP-24.** An S1 or S2 answer may raise only three of
  §23.11's ceilings, each by a stated amount: member fits up to 60,000, machine-hours up to 200,
  and active hours up to 70. Every other line of §23.11 never changes, including the attempts,
  the rounds, data, network and cost.
  - The answer is committed under `steering/` before use.
  - The Critic checks the caps against §23.11 together with those committed answers.

**The record.**

- **Committed before acting.** Every S1 and S2 exchange is committed verbatim under
  `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-24/steering/`, with its time, round and attempt, before the Lead
  acts on it.
- **The Orchestrator's limits.** The Orchestrator:
  - chooses among the Lead's proposals and never prescribes implementation;
  - does not review the code;
  - does not see the Critic's work before the verdict file exists.

  The Lead may refuse a steering answer that breaks this section, and says why.
- **What the delegation sets aside.** For CP-24 only, and without editing the file, the Owner's
  delegation (header) sets aside two rules of `orchestrator-role.md`:
  - "You must not launch, spawn, open, or impersonate an Engineering-Lead, Builder, Critic,
    NotebookLM, research-agent, or content-executor session";
  - "Yarden carries one brief down and one checkpoint return back".

  For the Critic fallback only, it also sets aside a third rule: "The Orchestrator never reads or
  manages internal agent exchanges".

  In their place, the Orchestrator:
  - launches the research agent, the plan critic and the Lead;
  - exchanges §23.6's steering messages;
  - launches the Integration Critic only if the Lead cannot. It then passes exactly
    `critic-open`'s printed prompt, and reads nothing of the review before the verdict file
    exists.

  No other channel exists. The Orchestrator attends the run, and the Owner is not asked to act
  before the LAND.

### 23.7 Entry gates and the frozen protocol

**4.6L′: provenance.** An addendum to CP-23's record, at
`reports/ddnn2/licence-admission.md`. It records:

- the method sources;
- that no third-party code or weights were copied;
- how the test-only reference is reused.

If provenance cannot be established, or the reference's licence is unresolved, DDNN-2 is
NOT_ADMITTED. The cap is 2 active hours.

**Correctness (§21.3, extended):**

- **The import audit** covers the search and every DDNN-2 module.
- **Finite-difference checks** cover:
  - the masked 24-hour Johnson SU loss;
  - the pinball loss through the Johnson SU quantile function;
  - L1 and L2;
  - dropout with fixed masks;
  - every activation in the space;
  - every target transform and its inverse.
- **PyTorch reference checks** cover the forward pass, the losses and their gradients, and short
  optimizer trajectories, at tolerances frozen before any comparison run.
  - **The pattern is CP-23's:** an explicitly invoked, non-collected script, like
    `tests/cp23/torch_reference_checks.py`, and a collected test of its committed record. CI
    installs only the root lock, so it stays green.
  - **The lock** is CP-23's test-only lock `tests/cp23/torch-reference/` (its `uv.lock` has
    SHA-256 `b3164a375e871396e685d0e887972b092fcd0c24a7fe0047167e8fc41c25dfed`), or a new
    test-only lock under `tests/cp24/` that pins the same versions.
  - **The root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` never change:** CP-10's and CP-15's evidence binds
    them.
  - **A missing reference fails** the explicit run; it never skips.

**4.6R′: training-only resource entry,** at `reports/ddnn2/resource-admission.md`. It runs on
pre-fold data, after the correctness checks.

- **It measures:**
  - peak memory;
  - fit and prediction time at the space's extremes;
  - finite, ordered emission.
- **It projects two routes** against §23.11, each with the review reserve:
  - the minimal route: one round, then attempt 1;
  - the maximal route: three rounds and attempt 1, then one round and attempt 2.
- **Its timing fits** forecast only validation-batch days, never a gate, warm-up or evaluation
  day.
- **Its record** (`resource-admission.md`) fixes three things, and each frozen protocol repeats
  them:
  - the trial count, at least 32 per fold per round, sized so that the maximal route fits;
  - the largest route that fits, if the maximal route does not fit at 32 trials;
  - the review reserve.
- **NOT_ADMITTED.** If the minimal route does not fit, DDNN-2 is NOT_ADMITTED with its cause,
  never a smaller experiment.

**The frozen protocol of each scored attempt** is committed before its first warm-up or
evaluation fit. It records:

- the representation, the input groups and their encoding;
- the search: space, priors, sampler, trial count, seeds, batch dates and ranking metric;
- every fold's chosen ensemble, with its validation scores;
- the gate's dates, its excluded training days and its results;
- the training recipe, the guards and the emission;
- the reference tolerances;
- the arms and the weight;
- the attempt number, the level and the rule's text;
- the budget accounting.

### 23.8 Population, metrics and diagnostics

**For every scored attempt,** §21.5's population, metrics and uncertainty apply:

- 10,747 keys and 638 origins;
- released errors at D−2 or earlier;
- the emitted p50's S_MAE and S_WIS, equal-fold and B0-normalised;
- the shared 2,000-replicate CP-20 index set, with seed 15042 and 7-day blocks within folds;
- per-fold paired daily-loss intervals;
- all six §8 diagnostics;
- coverage with width;
- the stress period and the peak.

v5 and v3+D2 take their warm-up errors from DDNN-2 fits at the warm-up origins. Ratio intervals
are reported at 97.5%, the decision level, and at 95% for comparison with CP-21 to CP-23.

**Contrasts,** each read under §17.5:

| Contrast | Role |
|---|---|
| v5 − v4 | The adoption decision (§23.9) |
| v5 − v3 | Reference |
| D2 − L, D2 − HG, D2 − v4 | DDNN-2 alone, against its same-information twin, LEAR and v4 |
| D2 − D | DDNN-2 against CP-23's DDNN |
| (v3+D2) − v4, beside (v3+D) − v4 | DDNN-2, then CP-23's DDNN, in LightGBM's place |
| (v3+D2) − v3 | DDNN-2 as v3's third member |
| v5 − (v3+D2) | Whether LightGBM still adds once DDNN-2 is present |

**Diagnostics,** descriptive and choosing nothing, delivered per attempt to `reports/ddnn2/`:

- D2's calibration: coverage by level and the PIT histogram;
- error correlations among D2, D, HG, A1_w, B2_w and L, pooled and by fold;
- MAE by local hour beside L and HG;
- extrapolation on extreme days, beside CP-23's record;
- the 2022 peak, fold 3 and fold 4;
- every guard activation and crossing;
- the search: each fold's ensemble, with its validation and gate scores beside its fold scores;
- member stability;
- a shape blend, descriptive only and never eligible: v4's p50 plus the average of the H layer's
  and D2's quantile offsets from their own medians;
- fit cost, and a cold daily cycle at 20 or more origins across the folds.

### 23.9 Pre-registered rule `cp24-adoption`, set 2026-10-05

v5 of scored attempt k (k ≤ 2) is adopted in research as v5 if, and only if, all five of these
hold against v4 on identical rows:

1. **Joint improvement over v4, at the attempts-adjusted level.** The paired v5 − v4 differences
   use two-sided 97.5% intervals: the 1.25% and 98.75% percentiles of the shared replicates.
   - The upper endpoint of ΔS_WIS is < 0.
   - The upper endpoint of ΔS_MAE is ≤ 0.
2. **No regression.** v5 meets all six original §8 diagnostics.
3. **A complete, valid evaluation.**
   - Engineering PASS with a fresh binding Integration verdict.
   - All 10,747 keys issued with finite, ordered quantiles.
   - Every guard activation reported.
4. **No resolved per-fold degradation.** No fold has a 95% paired daily-loss interval (v5 − v4)
   lying entirely above zero, in MAE or in WIS.
5. **A practical size.** Both point estimates improve v4's score by at least 0.5%:
   - ΔS_MAE ≤ −0.005·S_MAE(v4);
   - ΔS_WIS ≤ −0.005·S_WIS(v4).

**Why 97.5%.** The level in condition 1 splits 5% across the cap of two attempts. It is fixed in
advance, whatever number of attempts runs. Condition 4 stays at 95%, its stricter side.

**What the split does not cover.** The split controls the number of looks, not the adaptation of
attempt 2 to attempt 1's fold results. 4.7T carries that protection. Attempt 2 is the
Owner-delegated route of §23.6, never the Lead's discretion.

**Otherwise,** attempt k's v5 is not adopted, with its first unmet condition and its values.

**How the rule is applied:**

- mechanically, never re-weighted, re-thresholded or overridden after results;
- D2, v3+D2 and D are never eligible;
- a mixed result is no demonstrated joint preference, never equivalence;
- an INCOMPLETE or BLOCKED return yields no decision and nothing to publish.

**CP-24's outcome** is one of four:

- adopted in attempt k;
- the branch "DDNN-2 member on v4", with each scored attempt's first unmet condition;
- stopped at the pre-fold gate;
- DDNN-2 NOT_ADMITTED.

In every outcome, whatever DDNN-2 vectors exist are stored for 4.8.

**What adoption means:**

- **A research status, and provisional.** v1 remains the released product and the demo, and no
  designation, freeze or Live follows (§16).
- **The opponent.** At CP-24's landing, "same information, same opponent" comes to name v5.
- **4.7T** is the confirmation. Its frozen manifest carries v3, v4 and v5, with the number of
  DDNN looks disclosed, and nothing is re-tuned for it.
- **Naming, proposed:**
  - adopted: "v5 · DDNN-2 member added", with predecessor v4. The A3 transition is titled "From
    v4 to v5: adding a distributional neural network";
  - not adopted: the branch "DDNN-2 member on v4".

### 23.10 Causal and integrity controls

§21.7's controls and §20.7's applicable ones apply to DDNN-2, v5 and v3+D2. Each negative
assertion is paired with a positive control. In addition:

- **The search and the gate, fold by fold.**
  - **Negative controls.** Mutating any outcome on or after D0_f − 56 changes none of fold f's
    search results or its ensemble. Mutating any outcome on or after D0_f changes none of fold
    f's gate results.
  - **Positive controls.** Each of these can change the results:
    - mutating a validation-batch outcome can change fold f's search;
    - mutating a fold-f gate-day outcome can change fold f's gate;
    - mutating an earlier fold's evaluation day inside a later fold's training window can change
      that later fold's fits.
- **Statistics and transforms:**
  - every scaler, winsorisation quantile, imputation and transform statistic is fitted on the
    fit's own training rows, never on its held-out weeks or forecast rows;
  - the origin's level and scale use prices up to D−1 only;
  - inversion is exact at every quantile.
- **Recency.** Every member trains on days up to D−1 outside its own held-out weeks. As the
  positive control, mutating such a day moves the fit.
- **Weather coverage.** No pre-fold fit trains on an uncovered day, and the wrapper for v4's
  members changes nothing at covered origins. The paired positive controls:
  - v4's unwrapped member code refuses a fold-4 gate day;
  - removing the exclusion from a fold-4 search fit changes its training rows.
- **DST.** Fixtures cover the inputs, the loss mask and the emitted keys:
  - on real data, every transition day from 2019-03-31 to 2026-03-29. 2022-10-30 has no weather
    record, so its fixture covers prices, load, the loss mask and the keys;
  - a synthetic calendar fixture for 2026-10-25.
- **Pre-registration.** Each attempt's frozen-protocol commit is an ancestor of the first commit
  or ledger entry that contains any of its warm-up or evaluation forecasts, and precedes it in the
  ledger. The fitting and scoring entry points refuse otherwise.
- **v4's members on the gate days.** They reproduce committed fold vectors by the same code path,
  bit for bit or within a measured and recorded tolerance.
- **Composites:**
  - `c_v5 − c_v4 = (1/6)·(D2 − L)` within tolerance;
  - v5 and v3+D2 run on HG's H-layer code path.
- **Determinism.** One BLAS thread per worker, fixed seeds, a fixed batch order and restart
  replay.

### 23.11 Ceilings and calendar

These are maxima, not targets. 4.6R′ projects against them, and §23.6 allows a stated raise.

| Dimension | Maximum |
|---|---|
| New models | 1 (DDNN-2). 0 other families, information or learned weights |
| Scored attempts | 2 |
| Pre-fold rounds | 3 before attempt 1; 1 before attempt 2 |
| Policies per attempt | 1 eligible (v5); 2 study and attribution arms (D2, v3+D2); saved references v4, v3, A1, B2 and D |
| DDNN-2 member fits | 40,000 in total, including 4.6R′, rounds, gates, attempts, controls, reproduction, failures and review |
| v4-member fits on gate days | One pass at the 280 gate origins, reused across rounds, plus its parity checks |
| Replay | 12,000 new policy-days, gate days included |
| References and uncertainty | 3 reference passes. 6 bootstrap passes of 2,000 replicates, where a pass is one run over all of a scored attempt's contrasts: per scored attempt, two by the Lead and one for review |
| Compute | 150 aggregate machine-hours; at most 4 concurrent workers; BLAS 1; CPU only; no GPU, MPS or cloud |
| Memory and disk | 10 GiB RSS; 10 GiB added peak disk |
| Data, network and cost | 0 data bytes. If the local cache lacks CP-23's pinned PyTorch CPU wheels, the one permitted download is that same pinned set, from PyPI. 0 remote writes; $0 |
| Effort | About 35 active hours; hard ceiling of 50 |

**Before dependent work,** the Lead completes §14.6 E1–E4 for CP-24, with the Lead and Critic
sessions named by the Lead.

### 23.12 Publication packet and MLflow

§21.9 applies, with these changes:

- **Pinned rules, which the issued brief also records:**
  - PUBLISH_RULES 1.3, SHA-256
    `5a660864f8b82943174741320c71087a3d0508f707edeb997cb2c1395c1c73b4`;
  - the packet template `docs/track-b/publication-packet-template.md`, SHA-256
    `4efb01855ae2d9a6f54b5624607a93046b1fffa881e34af0c6798c513c7829cf`.
- **The packet:** `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-24/publication-packet.md`, in every outcome, with the
  claim map `docs/track-b/research-content/cp24-claims.md`. A stop is recorded as such. It
  carries:
  - draft registry entries for each scored attempt;
  - the derived quantities: the gate results, the number of rounds and scored attempts, and the
    adjusted level.
- **MLflow:**
  - the experiment is `delu-generations`;
  - local tracking only, in `.local/mlruns/cp24`;
  - a draft export, `reports/ddnn2/mlflow-export-draft/cp24.json`. A CP-24 module builds it by
    importing `scripts/mlflow_export.py`'s functions unchanged;
  - no public write.
- **Public surfaces are unchanged.** Publication follows the Owner's LAND and three Owner
  decisions:
  - v5's encoding, if v5 is adopted;
  - whether the not-adopted branches are published;
  - automation items 6 and 7 (§22).

### 23.13 Complete CP-24 acceptance checklist

All eighteen items are mandatory. Engineering PASS requires neither admission nor adoption: a
complete, valid NOT_ADMITTED, gate-stopped or not-adopted result can pass.

**After a stop:**

- a NOT_ADMITTED stop under item 3 makes items 4–14 not applicable;
- a NOT_ADMITTED stop under item 5 makes items 6–14 not applicable;
- a stop under item 7 before attempt 1 makes items 8–14 not applicable.

Each not-applicable item is recorded with the stop's evidence, and items 15–18 apply in full.

1. **Verify the starting state** and preserve prior evidence and other sessions' work.
   - Verify the ratified anchor's SHA-256 against the brief.
   - Record the baseline with `scripts/gauntlet.py start cp-24`.
   - Work only in the worktree `.local/worktrees/cp-24/lead`, on `gauntlet/cp-24`.
   - Package the issued brief byte for byte as `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-24/issued-brief.md`.
2. **Verify the inputs:**
   - population, manifest and frozen weather, including the coverage gap of §23.6;
   - saved-vector identities, including CP-23's D, reproduced from the objects preserved at the
     evidence tags where a live identity check no longer applies;
   - an independent representative HG and v4 slice;
   - no retrieval, and nothing after 2026-04-07.
3. **Complete 4.6L′.**
4. **Prove the code's correctness** under §23.7: the import audit, the finite-difference checks,
   and the PyTorch reference checks, installed so that they cannot be skipped silently.
5. **Complete 4.6R′** on pre-fold data, with PASS or NOT_ADMITTED and its cause. On
   NOT_ADMITTED, stop, with no gate and no comparison.
6. **Run every pre-fold round** (§23.4, §23.6), with no DDNN-2 or new-policy fit at a warm-up
   or evaluation origin:
   - each fold's search, recorded in a ledger;
   - the gate, with v4's members proven on the same code path and the weather-coverage rule
     applied;
   - the pre-fold report.
7. **Commit every S1 exchange** and, for each attempt that runs, its frozen protocol, before any
   of its warm-up or evaluation fits. Stop when §23.6 says the route ends.
8. **Implement exactly DDNN-2, v5 and the arms,** and prove composite parity.
9. **Prove every control** of §23.10 and the inherited ones, each negative paired with a
   positive.
10. **Produce all 10,747 keys for every new policy** in every scored attempt, with finite,
    ordered quantiles. Keep the emitted p50 separate from the central forecast.
11. **Score every policy of every attempt,** and independently verify:
    - the scores and the diagnostics;
    - coverage with width;
    - all six §8 diagnostics for each new policy.
12. **Apply `cp24-adoption` mechanically** to every scored attempt. State each decision with its
    first unmet condition, and every §23.8 contrast with its reading. Keep the Engineering,
    research and product statuses distinct.
13. **Respect the attempt bounds.** Commit the S2 exchange and any attempt 2 under §23.6's
    bounds. Run at most two scored attempts, and none after an adoption.
14. **Deliver §23.8's diagnostics** to `reports/ddnn2/`.
15. **Store whatever DDNN-2 vectors exist** for 4.8. **Enforce and report every §23.11 cap,**
    with any committed raise, and respect the calendar.
16. **Supply the durable evidence,** with executable reproduction commands and byte-exact
    storage.
    - Deliver §23.12's packet, which records any stop, and the draft export.
    - These stay unchanged: the public surfaces, the published export set,
      `scripts/mlflow_export.py`, and the root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`.
    - CI is green, and there is no public write.
17. **Obtain one fresh, independent Integration-Critic PASS** on a clean detached checkout of
    the final candidate. Launch it with `scripts/gauntlet.py critic-open`, `critic-brief` and
    `critic-close`. The review independently:
    - recomputes every scored attempt's metrics, intervals and verdict;
    - checks the gate's results and the steering record against §23.6;
    - checks pre-registration by Git ancestry and the ledgers;
    - reruns the reference checks;
    - reproduces a representative search trial, a representative DDNN-2 ensemble fit and its
      emission;
    - re-derives the packet.
18. **Return the canonical packet** (templates §3), checked with `scripts/gauntlet.py return`.
    It carries:
    - both terminal SHAs and the verdict-only delta;
    - resource totals, the number of rounds and scored attempts;
    - branch, worktree and stash accounting.

    Stop at CP-24's local result.

### 23.14 Paths and entry authority

**Write paths:**

- `src/cp24/`, `tests/cp24/`, `scripts/cp24_*.py`;
- `reports/ddnn2/`, `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-24/`;
- `docs/track-b/research-content/cp24-claims.md`.

**Never written:**

- the root `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock`;
- `scripts/mlflow_export.py`, and every file that CP-21's to CP-23's artifact manifests bind;
- `src/cp23/` and every earlier checkpoint's code and reports, which are reused by import.

**Ignored material:** `.local/{worktrees,artifacts,tmp}/cp-24/` and `.local/mlruns/cp24`.

**Read-only:**

- CP-15 to CP-23 code and reports;
- `evidence/cp-20`, `evidence/cp-21`, `evidence/cp-22` and `evidence/cp-23`;
- `.local/artifacts/cp-20/` to `cp-23/`.

**Preserve:** v1; all earlier evidence; the public surfaces; Q&A; `progress.md`; every locked
document.

**Roles:**

- **The executor.** The accountable executor is the CP-24 Engineering Lead, in its own worktree.
- **The reviewer.** Its fresh, independent Integration Critic.
- **Steering.** The Orchestrator steers only under §23.6.

**Ratification and CP-24's execution: GRANTED by the Owner's delegation of 2026-10-04** (the
header's authority). The grant covers:

- CP-24's execution under this section and the issued brief;
- local `gauntlet/cp-24` candidate and evidence commits, and exact packaging of the issued brief;
- the steering of §23.6, and the launches it names;
- the Orchestrator's commit and push of five things:
  - this revision;
  - its amendment record;
  - the research report;
  - the brief's record in `progress.md`;
  - the programme handoff's consistency edits.

**Never authorized here:**

- the LAND, which stays the Owner's by hand (`AGENTS.md`);
- any push or tag by the Lead or the Critic;
- publication and remote writes;
- data retrieval;
- any governance edit beyond this revision and its record;
- later checkpoints.

### 23.15 Decisions recorded, 2026-10-04 and 2026-10-05

| # | Decision | Set by | Ratified outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| D1 | The route | Owner | DDNN-2, delegated to the Orchestrator: research agent, plan, independent critic, execution agent, without the Owner until the report and the LAND request |
| D2 | This anchor | Owner | v21-r11, under a suspension that includes commit, push and every need |
| D3 | Discretion | Owner | The representation, the search, the ensemble, the weight in v5 and the ceilings are the Orchestrator's, and may change during the work |
| D4 | Representation and training | Orchestrator, under the delegation | Day-level rows with 96 outputs. Every member trains on data up to D−1, with random whole-week early stopping on the scored pinball loss (§23.3) |
| D5 | Search and ensemble | Orchestrator, under the delegation | Per-fold random search on batch-rolling validation that avoids every fold's days. The top four configurations with two seeds each, combined by the per-level median (§23.4) |
| D6 | The candidate and its weight | Orchestrator, under the delegation | v5 = (2/3)·c_HG + (1/6)·L + (1/6)·D2: DDNN-2 shares LightGBM's third. Fixed, never estimated (§23.5) |
| D7 | Steering and attempts | Orchestrator, under the delegation | A pre-fold gate; at most three rounds before attempt 1 and one before attempt 2; at most two scored attempts; steering at S1 and S2 only (§23.6) |
| D8 | The rule | Orchestrator, under the delegation | `cp24-adoption`: CP-23's four conditions with condition 1 at 97.5%, plus a 0.5% practical size (§23.9) |
| D9 | Ceilings | Orchestrator, under the delegation | §23.11, raisable at S1 or S2 to stated maxima (§23.6) |
| D10 | The reference tests | Orchestrator, under the delegation | CP-23's test-only lock, or a new one under `tests/cp24/` with the same pins; never the root lock |
| D11 | Weather coverage | Orchestrator, under the delegation | Pre-fold fits leave out the days without a frozen weather record (2022-09-29..2023-03-24); no retrieval (§23.6) |
| D12 | Publication | Orchestrator, under the delegation | None in CP-24; the Owner decides after the LAND |
