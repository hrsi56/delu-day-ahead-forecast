"""The daily issuance on the issuing host: the frozen chain, the shadow issuances, and the issued artifact.

This is the driver CP-18's pipeline and 4.7T's product run call once per delivery day, after the day's payloads
are built. It runs natively, because it starts the issuing host, and it is part of the frozen policy identity
(CP-17's review, N1): its hash is frozen beside the package's (`cp17.tools.bundle.PIPELINE`).

- **Each attempt** runs the package's own fit (`host/driver.py`, fit mode) in a fresh Pyodide process under the
  pinned Node.js (decision 10), with a fresh output path, so no earlier record can be read as its result, and a
  timeout equal to the success definition's wall-time ceiling. A process that is killed, times out, exits
  non-zero, dies without a record, or leaves an unreadable record or one of another run is a failed fit, and the
  chain moves on. The process's own wall time and peak resident memory judge criterion 5 (`cp17.issue.attempt`).
- **The chain** is `cp17.issue.decide`, with the artifact built and verified inside it (criterion 4, N3). A
  failed issuance is written and verified too.
- **The shadows** (decision 14). After the chain, v4, v2 and B0 are fitted for the same day under the issuing
  host, whether or not A1 succeeded; a fallback the chain already fitted is not fitted twice. A shadow passes the
  same input checks as an attempt (criterion 1); a day with no forecastable hour fits nothing, and on a day whose
  GFS is late or missing at the issue time v4's shadow is skipped, since its inputs are unavailable. Each fit
  is registered in its own state before the outcome (`cp17.shadow.ShadowStates.issue`), under CP-26's intake
  rule. A shadow is never published, displayed or scored as the product's forecast.
- **The native comparison** (`comparison_day`) runs the same chain in-process, with criterion 5 not judged. It is
  labelled as the comparison and can never issue (N2).
