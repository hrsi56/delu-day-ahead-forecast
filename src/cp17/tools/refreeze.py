"""CP-17b's re-freeze: the policy identity and freeze manifest that supersede CP-17's, and their verifier.

**What is pinned, and how** (the Owner's decision 19; brief item 4):

- **Governance documents** are bound by frozen copies under `docs/track-b/evidence/cp-17b/pinned/`, each with its
  SHA-256: the anchor at v21-r17, CP-17's two briefs and CP-17b's, both decisions records, and the CP-25 rulings
  and the CP-26 GFS ruling. `verify` checks the copies, never the live files, so an anchor amendment (r18) or a
  new decisions record leaves it green.
- **Computational inputs and code** are verified live: the snapshot, CP-25's and CP-26's manifests, CP-28's
  selection, the tier register, the partitions, the margin tables, the weather features and their gaps,
  CP-17-probe's runtime retrieval manifest, CP-15's protocol, `uv.lock`, `pyproject.toml`; every package file,
  the runners and the issuance driver (`cp17.daily`); the package's deterministic zip, rebuilt; the payload
  schemas, against the package's own.
- **Local runtimes and state** are verified live: the 23 Pyodide files, the Node.js binary, and A1's search state
  (`k13.json` in the `evidence/cp-26` extract), its file hash and content digest. A file present is always checked.
  On the issuing machine (one holding the project's pinned Pyodide or the extract) every one is required; elsewhere
  (CI) an absent one is reported as unchecked, never passed silently.
- **CP-17's freeze is superseded, not edited:** its evidence files are checked unchanged, by the hashes the brief
  cites. CP-17's own verifier (`cp17.tools.freeze`) stays as landed. It pins governance documents live, so it is run
  on `cp17_view`, whose governance documents are CP-17b's frozen copies; there it reports exactly the package files
  CP-17b changed (`tests/cp17/test_records.py`), and an amendment leaves it green.

`COVERAGE` states how each hash the manifest records is checked.
