"""4.7T's frozen analysis (item 8), executable and outcome-blind: written before any day after 2026-09-06
exists, and tested on synthetic losses only. It is run once, after the 4.7T gate, on the window's losses.

- **Window:** delivery days 2026-09-07 to 2026-12-05 (§24.3), 90 days, one look.
- **Primary scores:** each date's p50 MAE and seven-quantile WIS (`cp28.scoring.daily`), averaged over the
  date's paired scoring keys; dates weigh equally.
- **Endpoints** (decision 5, mirroring CP-28's gates):
  - against the control v5: `d = L_A1 - 0.995 * L_v5`, H0 `E[d] >= 0`, for MAE and for WIS;
  - against B0: `d = L_A1 - L_B0`, H0 `E[d] >= 0`, for MAE and for WIS.
- **The compound p-value** is the largest of the four; 4.7T passes when it is <= 0.05. One candidate, no Holm.
- **The dependence treatment:** CP-26's paired, non-circular, moving-block studentized bootstrap as CP-28
  lands it (`cp28.inference.test_endpoint`): 7-day blocks, 10,000 replicates, Bartlett HAC at lag 14, one
  calendar stratum (all of 2026), runs split at any missing date; a fresh `default_rng(SEED)` for the
  analysis, endpoints visited in the order v5-MAE, v5-WIS, B0-MAE, B0-WIS.
- **The minimum scorable support:** each comparison needs at least 60 of the 90 dates paired and scored;
  below it, 4.7T is inconclusive, the window is spent, and nothing is extended or rerun.

The product's losses are those of what it emitted: A1 on a successful fit, the frozen fallback otherwise
(counted by cause), and missing on a failed issuance (missing in every pairing that involves it).
