"""The one claim set every public surface renders from (§12 CP-3 item 5).

CP-3 item 5 requires the README, the static Pages export, the Space metadata and
the MLflow record to **agree** on the selected catalog, the metrics, the
development evidence class, the benchmark limitation, the champion's identity,
the holdout result with its power-qualification label, the statement that the
shipped model is the evaluated model, and all four §7.1 cutoffs separately.

Agreement between four hand-written documents is a promise. Agreement between
four documents rendered from one dict of strings is a property, and
`tests/test_17_cross_surface_agreement.py` asserts it -- with a positive control
that mutates a copy of a surface and requires the checker to fail, because a
consistency test that cannot fail is the CP-1 lesson this project already paid
for once.

Every value here is **read from a committed CP-2 artifact**, never retyped. The
formatting happens once, so "25.9078" is one string on four surfaces rather than
four roundings of one number.

    "an evaluation block averaging 376 EUR/MWh, and the conformal correction is additive, not "
