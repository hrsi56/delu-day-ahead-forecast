"""The registry: one source for every published identity, status and comparison (standard §5).

Publication Standard v1 §5 requires one entry per generation, branch, reference, study arm and
control, and requires every public surface to take its names, statuses and order from it: the
page's status pair, rail, jump row, lineage, comparison rows and chapter headers; the README's
headings; the Space cards' model line; and the `delu-generations` MLflow run names, parents,
descriptions and tags. Before PRES-1's conformance work those were typed in about 45 places in
nine files, and "current" was written into prose that becomes false the day v4 is adopted.

**Status is derived, never typed.** An entry carries a dated status history. A surface never
writes "current", "latest" or "the demo runs"; it asks this module, which answers from the
history -- `current_generation()`, `released()`, `status_sentence()` -- in the past tense and dated.

**One identity across experiment codes.** v2 is `V2-H` in CP-16 and `H0` in CP-20; v1 is `B1` in
CP-15 and `v1_reference` in CP-10. `by_code()` resolves either to the same entry, so a policy is
never renamed by the experiment that happens to evaluate it. A code is an experiment's own label, so
the same text can name different identities in different experiments: `v5` is CP-23's candidate,
the branch "DDNN member on v4", and CP-24's adopted v5. Inside one experiment a code names one
identity; `by_code(code, experiment)` resolves it there, and an unscoped lookup of a shared text
refuses rather than guess.

**Nothing here is a research number.** Dates, codes and names are identity; every score comes from
`delu_forecast.research` and `delu_forecast.derived`. `tests/test_35_registry.py` holds the
consistency checks and their negative controls.
